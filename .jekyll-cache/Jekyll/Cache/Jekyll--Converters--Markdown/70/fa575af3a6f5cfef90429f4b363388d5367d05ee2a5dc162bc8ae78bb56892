I"›<h2 id="recap">Recap</h2>

<p>Back in the Summer of 2018, I had a kind of foolish idea. I decided that I should try and organize all the types of information surrounding Bitcoin, Blockchain and Cryptocurrency, and began doing so in the channels of a discord server, SourceCrypto.</p>

<p>Since then, Iâ€™ve created a number of servers, realizing that it was easier to simply split off, and create a new one, once I wanted to get serious about another large subject.</p>

<p>Between a dozen discord servers, and a handful of twitter accounts, Iâ€™ve been seriously retweeting, sharing to focused channels, organizing, archiving and otherwise keeping track of valuable information that would otherwise slip awayâ€¦ into the abyss of the intellectâ€¦ along with all the other interesting things Iâ€™ve read, but didnâ€™t keep references for, over the years.</p>

<h2 id="a-collaborative-workflow">A Collaborative Workflow?</h2>

<p>A year later, the idea that I could organize the varieties of information surrounding Bitcoin still seems foolish. Perhaps not so much as it did when I began. I never assumed that I could really accomplish my objective, however, I felt it was important to act and believe as though it were possible.</p>

<p>Iâ€™ve only gotten serious about tech in the past few years, and have had quite a steep learning curve to catch up. To begin, I had a little experience maintaining Discord servers, and appreciate itâ€™s UX, so it made sense for me to start there, rather than starting by seeking the ideal solution.</p>

<p>Itâ€™s always been my intent for these resources to be collaborative, and they have been open for such from the beginning. I have appreciated a number of contributors over that time, but the work has primarily been my own. I will admit that Iâ€™ve not been very social, or acted as an effective community organizer. Regardless, Iâ€™m pretty sure Discord isnâ€™t the ideal venue for this work.</p>

<h2 id="foss-ideals-vs-pragmatism">FOSS Ideals vs Pragmatism</h2>

<p>Over the past year, Iâ€™ve gone deeper and deeper into the world of Bitcoin, FOSS, Indieweb, Decentralized Identity, standards organizations, working groups and mailing lists. Iâ€™ve studied histories surrounding AI, Decentralized Web, Cyberpunks, Cypherpunks, MIT hackers, Sovereign Identity, Cryptography, and other histories of computing and the internet.</p>

<p>During that time, the irony of using discord and twitter while preparing a foundation for a collaborative curation platform. Discord was a matter of convenience, Twitter was an essential component of my education. Despite itâ€™s shortcomings, there is a lot of value to be gained from studying various fields through the lense of Twitter.</p>

<h2 id="moving-forward">Moving Forward</h2>

<p>Itâ€™s time to move forward. Iâ€™d like to say Iâ€™m moving to 100% sovereign solutions, However, Iâ€™m not quite there yet. I have no definite answers, except that Iâ€™ll be restructuring this information into markdown and then structured data.</p>

<p>Iâ€™m just getting to know google sheets, and decided I should get to know the GSuite a litte better before dismissing it altogether (my inclinatino). However, spreadsheets are extensible, and an ideal stepping stone, between whatâ€™s in the archives, and a variety of applications.</p>

<p>Iâ€™ve also begun to experiment with Notion as a power tool. It allows me to import the individual html files of the archives, transform them into a single page, and then export them to markdown, from which itâ€™s managable to transform into a simple page of links organized by category, and from there to spreadsheets.</p>

<p>Mattermost and keybase are both strong contenders for group chat platforms, I see them both doing well over the coming years. As far as social media, I think Iâ€™m better off looking to forum platforms and mailing listsâ€¦ thatâ€™s a lot closer to the sources of information I tend to be looking for, and my target demographics.</p>

<h2 id="subscribe-for-updates">Subscribe for Updates</h2>

<p>The main reason for this post is to provide an update, since Iâ€™m taking a break from social media, particularly Discord and Twitter.. not sure how long of a break that will be, or how deep. However, Iâ€™ve deleted the discord servers, since Iâ€™ll never develop a new workflow, if Iâ€™m continually adding to the old ones.</p>

<p>Thatâ€™s why Iâ€™m backing off from my day to day curation, so I can organize what Iâ€™ve got, learn some new apps, and take it to the next level.</p>

<p>If youâ€™d like e-mail updates, since I wonâ€™t be on social media, you can sign up here. Eventually, I might experiment with a monthly newsletter or occasional promotional offers. However, that would be a distinct and separate opt-in list. This list is only for major site updates, such as:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Getting the archives re-structured, and published in a naviable form.</li>
  <li>Finding a chat application suitable for collaborative curation</li>
  <li>Launch of a shared spreadsheet application of SourceCrypto</li>
</ul>

<p>As this list is growing to include a small collection of people Iâ€™ve worked with in the past year, perhaps an occasional survey to get your feedback would be in order.</p>

<p>Personally, I have a hard time appreciating mailing lists that are sending updates all the timeâ€¦ pushing out content with hopes of generating leads. So yeah, Iâ€™m not into that, and this list doesnâ€™t even have an auto-reply saying thanks for subscribing, yet.</p>

<p>On the rare occasion I do send out an e-mail, youâ€™ll always have the option to unsubscribe, and Iâ€™ll make sure each message is worth your time.</p>
