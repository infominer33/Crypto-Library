<p>Back in the Summer of 2018, I had a kind of foolish idea. I decided that I should try and organize all the types of information surrounding Bitcoin, Blockchain and Cryptocurrency, and began doing so in the channels of a discord server, SourceCrypto.</p>

<p>Since then, I’ve created a number of servers, realizing that it was easier to simply split off, and create a new one, once I wanted to get serious about another large subject.</p>

<p>Between a dozen discord servers, and a handful of twitter accounts, I’ve been seriously retweeting, sharing to focused channels, organizing, archiving and otherwise keeping track of valuable information that would otherwise slip away… into the abyss of the intellect… along with all the other interesting things I’ve read, but didn’t keep references for, over the years.</p>

<h2 id="a-collaborative-workflow">A Collaborative Workflow?</h2>

<p>A year later, the idea that I could organize the varieties of information surrounding Bitcoin still seems foolish. Perhaps not so much as it did when I began. I never assumed that I could really accomplish my objective, however, I felt it was important to act and believe as though it were possible.</p>

<p>I’ve only gotten serious about tech in the past few years, and have had quite a steep learning curve to catch up. To begin, I had a little experience maintaining Discord servers, and appreciate it’s UX, so it made sense for me to start there, rather than starting by seeking the ideal solution.</p>

<p>It’s always been my intent for these resources to be collaborative, and they have been open for such from the beginning. I have appreciated a number of contributors over that time, but the work has primarily been my own. I will admit that I’ve not been very social, or acted as an effective community organizer. Regardless, I’m pretty sure Discord isn’t the ideal venue for this work.</p>

<h2 id="foss-ideals-vs-pragmatism">FOSS Ideals vs Pragmatism</h2>

<p>Over the past year, I’ve gone deeper and deeper into the world of Bitcoin, FOSS, Indieweb, Decentralized Identity, standards organizations, working groups and mailing lists. I’ve studied histories surrounding AI, Decentralized Web, Cyberpunks, Cypherpunks, MIT hackers, Sovereign Identity, Cryptography, and other histories of computing and the internet.</p>

<p>During that time, the irony of using discord and twitter while preparing a foundation for a collaborative curation platform. Discord was a matter of convenience, Twitter was an essential component of my education. Despite it’s shortcomings, there is a lot of value to be gained from studying various fields through the lense of Twitter.</p>

<p>All that to be said, it’s time to move forward. As much as I’d like to say I’m moving to 100% sovereign solutions, I’m not quite there yet. I have no definite answers, except that I’ll be restructuring this information into markdown and then structured data.</p>

<p>I’m just getting to know google sheets, and decided I should get to know the GSuite a litte better before dismissing it altogether (my inclinatino). However, spreadsheets are extensible, and an ideal stepping stone, between what’s in the archives, and a variety of applications.</p>
