# crypto-library

I've been building a library of informational materials surrounding Bitcoin, Blockchain, Cryptocurrency, Distributed Ledger Technology, and every related topic in a discord server.

I will gradually go through each of the channels in discord, and organize their resources in this repository. The decision to expand from Discord (which I love) to github (which is new to me) was, in part, inspired by the [Awesome Lists](https://github.com/sindresorhus/awesome/blob/master/awesome.md). That fact will be kept in mind while working on this repository. However, I generally collect resources with a few different purposes in mind, and thus expect this collection of resources to be a bit more expansive.

1. I collect resources because I love to read, and learn, and nerd out on subjects. 
2. I offer freelance research, and research based content.
   - I hate how empty of information most content is online.
3. Crypto\Blockchain\DLT is a very expansive sector.
   - It's impossible for anyone to know all of the things, but I'll try.
4. Proof-of-Brain â€” I don't have money, I have time.
