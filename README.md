# The Crypto Public Library — Super Source

A few of us have been building a library of informational materials surrounding Bitcoin, Blockchain, Cryptocurrency, and related topics in a discord server.  The *exciting news* is that this library is beginning to out-grow its discord server after only a few short months :)

There are currently **125 different channels**, with thousands of resources, each devoted to a particular aspect of crypto. Obviously knowledge can't be so easily compartmentalized, but we do our best we can. 

The big plan is to put all of these resources into an easily navigable web-application, so that individual resources can have multiple tags; each tag can act as it's own individual directory, and multiple groupings of tags can act as their own directory. Generally the idea is to streamline the process and make it more accessable.

A dynamic directory of crypto knowledge, and a discord bot so that you can query the library without having to scroll through channels or visit the web-site :)

We are now working on gathering all of the links into "toml" files, which are a simple format for transforming all of this information into a database. Of course all of that takes work. I very much enjoy the work, and it's a wonderful educational opportunity, but time consuming. 

Once all of the resources are tagged and in a real database the potential for this library grows exponentially.
Big plans are in the works for the Crypto Library — Super Source.

This is a great time to get involved, while our community is just beginning to form.

This has nothing to do with new, unknown, projects or ICOs (except for how to evaluate them). We will be gathering information on all of the top coins over time, regardless of our personal opinions.. ideally to have the the best information so that people can learn and make their own decisions.


### Project Overview

Generally speaking, this project will progress in the following stages:

**This plan will genereally progress in the following stages:**
1. Fill Discord Library with curated crypto resources (very good progress already)
2. Place crypt0library server history in machine readable format. 
     — The [toml](https://github.com/infominer33/Crypto-library/tree/master/toml) directory has some finished toml files that show exactly what that looks like and has further instructions on that aspect.
3. Create a web-page to dynamically interact with the database<br/>
4. Create a discord bot to bridge the web-page and various chat servers

### #2 is the most important and time consuming of these
