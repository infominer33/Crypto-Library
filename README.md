# The Crypto Public Library — Super Source
TLDR; Creating a collaborative web-directory of "source-grade" content. For writers, students, and research nerds to easily find source-grade crypto content. To do so we will first transform a discord server, full of crypto resources organized by topic, into a database that will power our web-directory.

### Introduction
At crypt0library.net, there are thousands of links organized categorically on an ever expanding array of crypto-related topics. Becoming familiar with the many facets of crypto is a monumental task. So much more difficult, because quality information can be difficult to find without quite a bit of background research. The library is a result of digging through search results to find the most informative content on given topics. When writing freelance, I commonly go through as many as 50 different links comparing different sources and cataloging any information I know will be useful later. Twitter and Reddit are also valuable sources of information, so much of it comes up organically.

We’ve started by focusing on fundamentals; general crypto topics; with a preference towards projects that are oldest, most dominant, respected, influential, etc. There are many new projects, but plenty of other research groups are focused on ICOs. The plan is to eventually cover all types of crypto knowledge, along with all of the top (somenumber) crypto projects. Seeking the highest quality information on projects regardless of our personal opinions on them, along with the highest quality criticism regardless of our personal opinions.

There are currently 125 different channels, with thousands of resources, each devoted to a particular aspect of crypto. Obviously knowledge can't be so easily compartmentalized, but we do our best. We also happen to have the largest, freely-available, collection of learning materials about trading and evaluating crypto projects than can be found anywhere else. If you're interested in that type of thing.

### Library Directory

In case you haven't been to the server yet, here is its directory to give you an idea of how it's organized:

This has nothing to do with new, unknown, projects or ICOs (except for how to evaluate them). We will be gathering knowledge and resources on all of the top coins over time, regardless of personal opinions.. ideally to have the the best information all in one place, so that people can learn and make their own decisions.

### The Plan and Problem
In case it hadn't occured to you, having resources organized in 100+ discord channels isn't the most user-friendly way to run a library. It worked great when there were half as many channels, but as the library grows we need more flexibility.
The plan is to build a dynamic directory of crypto knowledge, searchable and manually navigable, and multi-platform chat-bots so that you can query the library without having to scroll through channels or visit the web-site :)

We are now working on gathering all of the links into "toml" files, which are a simple format for transforming all of this information into a database. Of course all of that takes work. I very much enjoy the work, and it's a wonderful educational opportunity, but time consuming. 

Once all of the resources are tagged and in a real database the potential for this library grows exponentially.
Big plans are in the works for the Crypto Library — Super Source.

This is a great time to get involved, while our community is just beginning to form.

### Project Overview

Generally speaking, this project will progress in the following stages:

**This plan will genereally progress in the following stages:**
1. Fill Discord Library with curated crypto resources (very good progress already)
2. Place crypt0library server history in machine readable format. 
     — The [toml](https://github.com/infominer33/Crypto-library/tree/master/toml) directory has some finished toml files that show exactly what that looks like and has further instructions on that aspect.
3. Create a web-page to dynamically interact with the database<br/>
4. Create a discord bot to bridge the web-page and various chat servers

### #2 is the most important and time consuming of these
