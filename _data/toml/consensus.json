  "A Guide to 99% Fault Tolerant Consensus": {
    "Description": "We've heard for a long time that it's possible to achieve consensus with 50% fault tolerance in a synchronous network where messages broadcasted by any honest node are guaranteed to be received by all other honest nodes within some known time period (if an attacker has more than 50%, they can perform a '51% attack', and there's an analogue of this for any algorithm of this type). We've also heard for a long time that if you want to relax the synchrony assumption, and have an algorithm that's 'safe under asynchrony', the maximum achievable fault tolerance drops to 33% (PBFT, Casper FFG, etc all fall into this category). But did you know that if you add even more assumptions (specifically, you require observers, ie. users that are not actively participating in the consensus but care about its output, to also be actively watching the consensus, and not just downloading its output after the fact), you can increase fault tolerance all the way to 99%?",

  "A MetaAnalysis of Proposed Alternative Consensus Protocols for Blockchains": {
    "Description": "Abstract\u2014Blockchain technology has been gaining popularity in the public, in industry, and in academia. However, these systems are currently limited in their ability to support robust, large-scale applications due to scalability and security challenges [12]. A fundamental step to resolving some of these challenges lies in the blockchain consensus layer. As such, both industry and academia are heavily investing in alternative consensus research and development, seeking alternatives to Bitcoin's Nakamoto consensus. Many of these protocols favor Proof of Stake (PoS) as a Sybil control mechanism to today's Proof of Work (PoW) [15]. However, thus far there has been no comprehensive, rigorous comparison of these alternative consensus protocols. This paper presents a systematization of knowledge within these major blockchain protocols, understanding the common challenges and solutions, and providing a formal structure within which to compare them. We break down these protocols by network, adversarial, and economic model, deeply understanding the common challenges of choosing proposers and committees, propagation, and finality",

Protocols based on proof-of-stake (PoS) allocate the right to update the blockchain randomly across users. The chance of any user to win the right is linked to his stake in the system, for example, the number of units of cryptocurrency the user owns. However, these alternative systems usually do not possess a key feature of PoW: one needs to spend a large amount of resources to be successful in cheating, and being unsuccessful means that one has incurred a large, irretrievable sunk cost.",

  "Blockchain Without Waste: Proof-of-Stake": {
    "Description": "blockchain constitutes a distributed ledger that records transactions across a network  of  agents.   Blockchain's  value  proposition  requires  that  agents  eventually  agree on the ledger's contents since payments possess risk otherwise.  Restricted blockchains ensure this consensus by appointing a central authority to dictate payment validity.  Permissionless blockchains (e.g.  Bitcoin, Ethereum), however, admit no central authority and  therefore  face  a  non-trivial  issue  of  inducing  consensus  endogenously.   Nakamoto (2008) provided a temporary solution to the problem by invoking an economic mechanism known as Proof-of-Work (PoW). PoW, however, lacks sustainability, so, in recent years,  a  variety  of  alternatives  have  been  proposed.   This  paper  studies  the  most  famous such alternative, Proof-of-Stake (PoS). I provide the first formal economic model of  PoS and  demonstrate  that PoS induces  consensus  in equilibrium.   My result  arises because I endogenize blockchain coin prices.  Propagating disagreement introduces risk and thereby reduces blockchain coin value which implies that stake-holders face an implicit cost from delaying consensus.  PoS randomly selects a stake-holder to update the blockchain and provides her an explicit monetary incentive, a \u201cblock reward,\u201d for her service.  In the event of disagreement, block rewards constitute a perverse incentive, but I demonstrate that restricting updating ability to large stake-holders induces an equilibrium in which consensus obtains as soon as possible.  I also demonstrate that consensus obtains eventually almost surely in any equilibrium so long as the blockchain employs a modest block reward schedule.  My work reveals the economic viability of permissionless blockchains.",

  "Casper 0.1 specification notes": {
    "Description": "Casper is a proof of stake consensus algorithm, which employs the following principles:\n\nSecurity deposits: stakeholders place security deposits behind blocks. A security deposit placed behind any block can be introduced as a transaction into an incompatible block in order to destroy the validator's security deposit. A block is only considered 'finalized' when some large percentage of validators make security deposits behind it.\nConsensus by bet: the concept of security deposits is philosophically extended into a concept of 'bets'; a bet in a proof of stake system is a transaction which, by in-consensus incentivization rules, gives you X extra coins in every chain that contains the block you bet on in exchange for taking away Y coins in every chain that does not contain that block. Essentially, it constitutes \u201cplacing down one's stake\u201d and claiming that \u201cthis block will succeed with at least probability Y/(X+Y)\u201d. The allowable values for X and Y should be set by a proper scoring rule. The principle of Casper is that validators bet based on what other validators are betting, and rational play in this game is a positive feedback loop and so leads to rapid consensus. \u201cFinality\u201d is defined by \u2154 of validators being willing to make a bet on a block large enough that Y is equal to their entire deposit.\nBy-block consensus: vote yes/no on each block height separately; the inclusion of a block does NOT imply inclusion of any particular block at any previous height",

  "Compounding of Wealth in Proof-of-Stake Cryptocurrencies": {
    "Description": "Abstract. Proof-of-stake (PoS) is a promising approach for designing efficient blockchains, where block proposers are randomly chosen with probability proportional to their stake. A primary concern with PoS systems is the \u201crich getting richer\u201d phenomenon, whereby wealthier nodes are more likely to get elected, and hence reap the block reward, making them even wealthier. In this paper, we introduce the notion of equitability, which quantifies how much a proposer can amplify her stake compared to her initial investment. Even with everyone following protocol (i.e., honest behavior), we show that existing methods of allocating block rewards lead to poor equitability, as does initializing systems with small stake pools and/or large rewards relative to the stake pool. We identify a geometric reward function, which we prove is maximally equitable over all choices of reward functions under honest behavior and bound the deviation for strategic actions; the proofs involve the study of optimization problems and stochastic  dominances  of  P \u0301olya  urn  processes,  and  are  of  independent  mathematical  interest.  These results allow us to provide a systematic framework to choose the parameters of a practical incentive system for PoS cryptocurrencies.",

This post aims to provide a broad overview of Casper and clarify some of the confusion with respect to the two protocol design efforts related to Casper. The two proposed implementations share the same core design principle: applying cryptoeconomic mechanism design to secure the network while managing challenges regarding liveness, safety and synchrony assumptions. This post is also an overview of the progress so far and the challenges that lie ahead. Most importantly for fellow newcomers, the post identifies & defines key concepts and ties together various helpful resources under one context. The overarching intention is to make Casper and proof of stake more approachable to everyone in the community.",

    "Description": "Proof of Stake (PoS) is a category of consensus algorithms for public blockchains that depend on a validator's economic stake in the network. In proof of work (PoW) based public blockchains (e.g. Bitcoin and the current implementation of Ethereum), the algorithm rewards participants who solve cryptographic puzzles in order to validate transactions and create new blocks (i.e. mining). In PoS-based public blockchains (e.g. Ethereum's upcoming Casper implementation), a set of validators take turns proposing and voting on the next block, and the weight of each validator's vote depends on the size of its deposit (i.e. stake). Significant advantages of PoS include security, reduced risk of centralization, and energy efficiency.",

    "Description": "In the blockchain setting, finality is the affirmation that all well-formed blocks will not be revoked once committed to the blockchain. When users transact, they want to be confident that once their transactions go through, that the transactions cannot be arbitrarily changed or reversed. As such, in designing a blockchain consensus protocol, finality becomes vital. In current Nakamoto consensus based systems, 51% attacks and selfish mining threaten the health of the system by allowing the possibility for blocks to be revoked (eg. if a malicious actor is able to accumulate 51% of mining power, they can conduct a double spend attack). These protocols offer probabilistic finality, while others can guarantee absolute finality.",

    "Description": "Not sure if these papers should be posted to this forum (my instinct is that they should!), but trying it as an experiment (instead of just discussing on Twitter).\n\nAt a conceptual level, the barriers stem from the following: all cryptocurrencies require some source of (pseudo)randomness. In Proof-of-Work, this pseudorandomness is in some sense external to the cryptocurrency: the first miner to successfully find a good nonce produces the next block, and this miner is selected completely independently of the current state of the cryptocurrency. In Proof-of-Stake, it is highly desirable that the pseudorandomness comes from within the cryptocurrency itself, versus an external source (due to network security concerns discussed in Section 2). One might initially suspect that with sufficiently many hashes or digital signatures of past blocks, this can indeed serve as a good source of pseudorandomness for future blocks. However, we formalize surprising barriers showing a fundamental difference between external pseudorandomness and pseudorandomness coming from the cryptocurrency itself.",

Each Obelisk node has a list of other nodes it subscribes to. Those nodes influence consensus and voting decisions for the local node. For non-pathological network topologies, the local consensus provably converges in to a global consensus.",

To ensure a consistent view of token ownership, Nakamoto used a public ledger which can be replicated and validated by all network participants.  To avoid a single point of failure, this ledger is authenticated using a dynamic membership multiparty signature (DMMS) consisting of an expensive (but cheaply verifiable) computation done on the entire ledger history every \u201cheartbeat\u201d.\nUnlike a traditional digital signature, there is no notion of \u201cforgeability\u201d for a DMMS. Instead, every DMMS is costly to produce (in Bitcoin, by requiring a large energy expenditure) and rewarded by introduction of new coins on the ledger.

Proof-of-stake  replaces  proof-of-work  to  provide  most  of  the  network  security. Under  this  hybrid  design  proof-of-work  mainly  provides  initial  minting  and  is largely  non-essential  in  the  long  run.  Security  level  of  the network  is  not dependent  on  energy  consumption  in  the  long  term  thus  providing  an  energy-efficient  and  more  cost-competitive  peer-to-peer  crypto-currency.  Proof-of-stake is  based  on  coin  age  and  generated  by  each  node  via  a  hashing  scheme  bearing similarity  to  Bitcoin's  but  over  limited  search  space.

    "Description": "In a previous paper, it was discussed whether Bitcoin and/or its blockchain could be considered a complex system and, if so, whether a chaotic one, a positive response raising concerns about the likelihood of Bitcoin/blockchain entering a chaotic regime, with catastrophic consequences for  financial systems based on it. This paper intends to simplify and extend that analysis to other PoW, PoS, and hybrid protocol-based cryptocurrencies. As before, this study was carried out ith the help of Information Theory of Complex Systems, in general, and Crutchfield's Statistical Complexity measure, in particular.  This paper is a work in progress. Whereas PoW consensus was shown to be highly noncomplex, the Nxt PoS consensus method studied shows an outstandingly higher measure of complexity, which is undesirable because it introduces unnecessary complexity into what should be a simple computational system. This paper is a work - in - progress and undoubtedly prone to incorrectness as a few cryptocurrencies may have changed their consensus algorithms. As next step, we intend to uncover some other measures that capture the qualitative notion of complexity of systems that can be applied to these cryptocurrencies to compare with the results he re obtained. As a final thought, however, considering that a certain amount of chaoticity may have been potentially introduced in the Bitcoin market by the presence of the capital gains seekers, one could wonder whether the recent surge of blockchain technology based startups, even discounting all the scam cases, could not help to reduce non-linearity and prevent chaos",

We believe that Byzantinefault-tolerant algorithms will be increasingly important in the future because malicious attacks and software errors are increasingly common and can cause faulty nodes to exhibit arbitrary behavior.

We implemented a Byzantine-fault-tolerant NFS service using our algorithm and measured its performance. The results show that ourservice is only 3% slower than a standard unreplicated NFS.",

  "Proof of Elapsed Time": {
    "Description": "As more applications are built on top of blockchain and public ledger, different approaches are developed to improve the performance of blockchain construction. Recently Intel proposed a new concept of proofof-elapsed-time (PoET), which leverages trusted computing to enforce random waiting times for block construction. However, trusted computing component may not be perfect and 100% reliable. It is not clear, to what extent, blockchain systems based on PoET can tolerate failures of trusted computing component. The current design of PoET lacks rigorous security analysis and a theoretical foundation for assessing its strength against such attacks. To fulfill this gap, we develop a theoretical framework for evaluating a PoET based blockchain system, and show that the current design is vulnerable in the sense that adversary can jeopardize the blockchain system by only compromising \u0398(log log n/ log n) fraction of the participating nodes, which is very small when n is relatively large. Based on our theoretical analysis, we also propose methods to mitigate these vulnerabilities.",

The basic idea is to ask the service requestor to dedicate some non-trivial amount of computational work to every request. The original applications included prevention of spam and protection against denial of service attacks. More recently, PoWs have been used to prevent double spending in the Bitcoin digital currency system. In this work, we put forward an alternative concept for PoWs \u2013 so-called proofs of space (PoS), where a service requestor must dedicate a significant amount of disk space as opposed to computation. We construct secure PoS schemes in the random oracle model (with one additional mild assumption required for the proof to go through), using graphs with high \u201cpebbling complexity\u201d and Merkle hash-trees. We discuss some applications, including follow-up work where a decentralized digital currency scheme called Spacecoin is constructed that uses PoS (instead of wasteful PoW like in Bitcoin) to prevent double spending.\n\nThe main technical contribution of this work is the construction of (directed, loop-free) graphs on N vertices with in-degree O(log log N) such that even if one places \u0398(N) pebbles on the nodes of the graph, there's a constant fraction of nodes that needs \u0398(N) steps to be pebbled (where in every step one can put a pebble on a node if all its parents have a pebble)",

Formally, we define the PoST resource as a trade-off between CPU work and space-time (under reasonable cost assumptions, a rational user will prefer to use the lower-cost space-time resource over CPU work).\nCompared to a proof-of-work, a PoST requires less energy use, as the 'difficulty' can be increased by extending the time period over which data is stored without increasing computation costs. Our definition is very similar to 'Proofs of Space' but, unlike the previous definitions, takes into account amortization attacks and storage duration. Moreover, our protocol uses a very different (and simpler) technique, making use of the fact that we explicitly allow a space-time tradeoff, and doesn't require any non-standard assumptions (beyond random oracles).",

  "SPECTRE: Serialization of Proof-of-Work Events, Confirming Transactions via Recursive Elections": {
    "Description": "Bitcoin utilizes the Nakamoto Consensus to achieve agreement on a consistent set of transactions, in the permissionless setting, where anyone can participate in the protocol anonymously. Since its rise, many other permissionless consensus protocols have been proposed. We present SPECTRE, a new protocol for the consensus core of cryptocurrencies that remains secure even under high throughput and fast confirmation times. At any throughput, SPECTRE is resilient to attackers with up to 50% of the computational power (reaching the limit defined by network congestion and bandwidth constraints). SPECTRE can operate at arbitrarily high block creation rates, which implies that its transactions confirm in mere seconds (limited mostly by the round-trip-time in the network).\n\nSPECTRE's underlying model falls into the category of partial synchronous networks: its security depends on the existence of some bound on the delivery time of messages between honest participants, but the protocol itself does not contain any parameter that depends on this bound. Hence, while other protocols that do encode such parameters must operate with extreme safety margins, SPECTRE converges according to the actual network delay.\n\nKey to SPECTRE's achievements is the fact that it satisfies weaker properties than classic consensus requires. In the conventional paradigm, the order between any two transactions must be decided and agreed upon by all non-corrupt nodes. In contrast, SPECTRE only satisfies this with respect to transactions performed by honest users. We observe that in the context of money, two conflicting payments that are published concurrently could only have been created by a dishonest user, hence we can afford to delay the acceptance of such transactions without harming the usability of the system. Our framework formalizes this weaker set of requirements for a cryptocurrency's distributed ledger. We then provide a formal proof that SPECTRE satisfies these requirements.",

  "Snowflake to Avalanche: A Novel Metastable Consensus Protocol Family for Cryptocurrencies": {
    "Description": "This paper introduces a new family of leaderless Byzantine fault tolerance protocols, built on a metastable mechanism. These protocols provide a strong probabilistic safety guarantee in the presence of Byzantine adversaries, while their concurrent nature enables them to achieve high throughput and scalability. Unlike blockchains that rely on proof-of-work, they are quiescent and green. Surprisingly, unlike traditional consensus protocols which require...",

  "Stake Pools in Cardano": {
    "Description": "In a proof of stake (PoS) blockchain protocol, the ledger is maintained by the stakeholders that hold assets in that ledger. This allows PoS blockchains to use less energy compared with proof of work (PoW) or other types of blockchain protocols. Nevertheless, this requirement imposes a burden on stakeholders. It requires a good number of them to be online and maintain sufficiently good network connectivity that they can collect transactions and have their PoS blocks reach the others without substantial network delays. It follows that any PoS ledger would benefit from reliable server nodes that hold stake and focus on maintenance.",

  "The Byzantine Generals Problem": {
    "Description": "Reliable computer systems must handle malfunctioning components that give conflicting information to different parts of the system. This situation can be expressed abstractly in terms of a group of generals of the Byzantine army camped with their troops around an enemy city. Communicating only by messenger, the generals must agree upon a common battle plan. However, one or more of them may be traitors who will try to confuse the others. The problem is to find an algorithm to ensure that the loyal generals will reach agreement. It is shown that, using only oral messages, this problem is solvable if and only if more than two-thirds of the generals are loyal; so a single traitor can confound two loyal generals. With unforgeable written messages, the problem is solvable for any number of generals and possible traitors. Applications of the solutions to reliable computer systems are then discussed.",

  "Understanding Serenity \u2014 Part I Abstraction": {
    "Description": "Serenity is intended to have two major feature sets: abstraction, a concept that I initially expanded on in this blog post here, and Casper, our security-deposit-based proof of stake algorithm. Additionally, we are exploring the idea of adding at least the scaffolding that will allow for the smooth deployment over time of our scalability proposals, and at the same time completely resolve parallelizability concerns brought up here - an instant very large gain for private blockchain instances of Ethereum with nodes being run in massively multi-core dedicated servers, and even the public chain may see a 2-5x improvement in scalability. Over the past few months, research on Casper and formalization of scalability and abstraction (eg. with EIP 101) have been progressing at a rapid pace between myself, Vlad Zamfir, Lucius Greg Meredith and a few others, and now I am happy to announce that the first proof of concept release for Serenity, albeit in a very limited form suitable only for testing, is now available.",

    "Description": "The keystone mechanism of Casper is the introduction of a fundamentally new philosophy in the field of public economic consensus: the concept of consensus-by-bet. The core idea of consensus-by-bet is simple: the protocol offers opportunities for validators to bet against the protocol on which blocks are going to be finalized. A bet on some block X in this context is a transaction which, by protocol rules, gives the validator a reward of Y coins (which are simply printed to give to the validator out of thin air, hence \"against the protocol\") in all universes in which block X was processed but which gives the validator a penalty of Z coins (which are destroyed) in all universes in which block X was not processed.",

    "Description": "At the core of every distributed fault-tolerant system is the fundamental problem of ensuring that all remote processes within said systems arrive at the same conclusion. This is known as requiring \u2018consensus' among participants. In completely reliable, controlled environments where faulty processes are tightly monitored and swiftly corrected, reaching consensus is straightforward. Real world decentralized protocols, however, are subject to significantly more arbitrary failures, requiring much higher reliability guarantees in order to be useful, much less secure. As Ethan Buchman at Cosmos puts it, distributed consensus mechanisms must 'make a reliable system from unreliable parts.'",

To understand proof of stake, it is important to have a basic idea of proof of work. As of this writing, the proof of work method is used by Bitcoin, Ethereum and most other major cryptocurrencies.",
