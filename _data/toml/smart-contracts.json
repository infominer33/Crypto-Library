    "Description": "The author presents a mini-language for professionals and researchers interested in drafting and analyzing contracts. It is intended for computers to read, too. The main purpose of this language is to specify, as unambiguously and completely and succinctly as possible, common contracts or contractual terms. These include financial contracts, liens and other kinds of security, transfer of ownership, performance of online services, and supply chain workflow. ",

  "A Look At Smart Contracts, Use cases and DApps": {
    "Description": "Smart contracts are self-executing code that defines and executes an agreement between multiple parties. That code contains simple \u201cif/when\u2026then\u2026\u201d statements executed within a distributed network that achieves consensus on transactions made within it. For example, a smart contract could define conditions for a payment from party A to party B, and other conditions for returning the funds back to party A; perhaps after a certain amount of time passed without the first conditions being met. This innovation allows for the elimination of trusted intermediaries in a wide range of programmable agreements. Smart contract enabled transactions are fully traceable, transparent, and irreversible.",

  "Bribery Resistant Voting Schemes for Smart Contracts": {
    "Description": "Recently, a number of proposals and applications have evolved on Ethereum that require voting; from contracts that use voting-based DAOs 6 for governance 4 or other administrative tasks, to boardroom-like votes 7 to proposals for open source funding 6. Voting appears to be a natural target for Ethereum and applications. Unfortunately, the space of voting algorithms opens a new class of buying and bribery coordination mechanisms 11 that could prove devastating in permissionless networks, either as credible threats or as actual deployed threats. Some schemes, even ones which assume robust identity, may be even more vulnerable than naive schemes 8.\n\nBeyond the standard integrity and privacy properties of a voting scheme\u2014 that votes are counted correctly and voters remain secret\u2014 for many applications we want a scheme that is bribery resistant. In on-chain voting schemes today, this is not the case: users can prove how they voted and thus be paid for their vote. Moreover, this can be done with a smart contract or \u201cDark DAO\u201d, making it trustless. A natural question is whether technical protections against such an attack are possible in-protocol.",

    "Description": "Marlowe: financial contracts on blockchain\n\nBlockchains allow the specification of contracts in the form of programs that guarantee their fulfilment. Nevertheless, errors in those programs can cause important, and often irretrievable, monetary loss. General-purpose languages provide a platform on which contracts can be built, but by their very generality they have the potential to exhibit behaviours of an unpredictable kind, and are also not easy to read or comprehend for general users.\nAn alternative solution is provided by domain-specific languages (DSLs), which are designed to express programs in a particular field. This paper explores the design of one DSL, Marlowe, targeted at the execution of financial contracts in the style of Peyton Jones et al on blockchains. We present an executable semantics of Marlowe in Haskell, an example of Marlowe in practice, and describe the Meadow tool that allows users to interact in-browser with simulations of Marlowe contracts.",

In fact, it is clear that electronic evidence must hold greater weight than verbal evidence (Lord Justice Auld, Sept 2001, Cpt 11). What is not clear is the extent of the weight attached to the various forms of electronic evidence. The strength of a digital signature algorithm and the security surrounding the mechanisms used to sign an electronic document will respectively influence the weight associated with any piece of electronic evidence.",

By using cryptographic and other security mechanisms, we can secure many algorithmically specifiable relationships from breach by principals, and from eavesdropping or malicious interference by third parties, up to considerations of time, user interface, and completeness of the algorithmic specification.

So let's try that out: which should you choose? Smart or Ricardian? Let's find out.\n\nThe original Ricardian Contract captures the legal contract behind an issuance, which is generally a simple payment system moving money from and even what will be one account to another. It is a document that includes all the good stuff people need to know, and a little technical stuff the program needs to know as well. On the whole, the Riccy looks like a contract, by design.

    "Description": "The advent of writing greatly improved the tracking of property rights, and indeed gave rise to our modern systems of property rights and law. However, written records have proven to be quite vulnerable to abuse. A common pattern during eras of political instability or oppression has been the confiscation of land via the forgery or destruction of public records. Reconstruction from informal records, such as residency recorded in phone books, even when possible is costly and fraught with error and potential for fraud. Large amounts of, in some areas most, property in developing countries is not formally titled. Even during eras of political stability in developed countries, there occur many expensive problems with titles. Straightforward transcription of written records into a centralized online repository would make many of these problems even worse \u2013 electronic records can be highly vulnerable to loss and forgery, and insiders are the most common source of such attacks. This paper proposes a secure, distributed title database to prevent such attacks against property rights in the future. ",

    "Description": "Smart contracts are self-executing contracts with the terms of the agreement between buyer and seller being directly written into lines of code. The code and the agreements contained therein exist across a distributed, decentralized blockchain network. Smart contracts permit trusted transactions and agreements to be carried out among disparate, anonymous parties without the need for a central authority, legal system, or external enforcement mechanism. They render transactions traceable, transparent, and irreversible.",

    "Description": "The contract, a set of promises agreed to in a 'meeting of the minds', is the traditional way to formalize a relationship. While contracts are primarily used in business relationships (the focus of this article), they can also involve personal relationships such as marraiges. Contracts are also important in politics, not only because of 'social contract' theories but also because contract enforcement has traditionally been considered a basic function of capitalist governments.",

    "Description": "The key feature of a smart contract is that it has trustless execution. That is, you don't need to rely on a third party to execute various conditions. Instead of relying on the other party to make good on their word or even worse, relying on lawyers and the legal system to remedy things should something go wrong, a smart contract executes what's supposed to happen timely and objectively.",

  "Wet Code and Dry": {
    "Description": "There's a strong distinction to be made between 'wet code,' interpreted by the brain, and 'dry code,' interpreted by computers. Human-read media is wet code whereas computer code and computer-readable files (to the extent a computer deals meaningfully with them) are \"dry code.\" Law is wet code, interpreted by those on whom the law is imposed, and interpreted (often somewhat differently) by law enforcers, but most authoritatively (and even more differently) interpreted by judges. Human language is mostly wet code but to the extent computer programs crudely translate from one language to another, keyword-ad programs parse text to made an educated guess as to what ads a user will most likely click, and so on, human language text can also be dry code. Traditional contracts are wet code whereas smart contracts are mostly dry code. Secure property titles and the domain name system are mostly dry code.",

  "What are Smart Contracts on Blockchain?": {
    "Description": "Smart contracts are lines of code that are stored on a blockchain and automatically execute when predetermined terms and conditions are met. At the most basic level, they are programs that run as they've been set up to run by the people who developed them. The benefits of smart contracts are most apparent in business collaborations, in which they are typically used to enforce some type of agreement so that all participants can be certain of the outcome without an intermediary's involvement.",
