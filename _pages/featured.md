excerpt: "[Source Crypto Discord Chat](https://discord.gg/ahTuPMY) is a landing pad.. I drop links there on the fly, occasionaly exporting and publishing the [channels](/discolog/) here. The next step is to systematically build better, more organized resources with the server as a starting point."

So the application section is in rough shape.. I don't spend a lot of time there. Tech, History, Development, Webwork. I care about real web technologies."
