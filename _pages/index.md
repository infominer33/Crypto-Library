**Collecting and Cataloging Quality\Valuable Information, in conjunction with the SuperSource Discord chat.**

You may have noticed this site going through some transformations lately. First of all, I realized that GitHub Pages \ Jekyll have built-in support for yaml, csv, and json... so, yaml is nice and we'll go with that. the great thing is that pages is designed to generate content based upon structured data. So we'll be a lot closer to the dream now.

I also found out about [Tyrrrz/DiscordChatExporter](https://github.com/Tyrrrz/DiscordChatExporter/issues/75) and how to use its exe file from the linux command line.. well that app will take your entire server and turn it into HTML... so that's what we have here, I integrated that with the site :D  

Source Crypto discord is a landing pad.. I drop links there on the fly, so those pages are not organized well, and maybe not all the links are 100% the best ever... Next will be to systematically go through and start building better, more organized resources built and driven by research.

So little by little, we'll map out the ecosystem of information around blockchain and cryptocurrencies, and those un-organized pages will grow to become each a formidible resource of its own.

*What follows is somewhat depreciated.. but I'll leave it until I have time to really focus on it.*


The problem is that information is not so neatly organized, since each subject is related to the others. I **could** make a page that goes in-depth on every subject, but then I'd be re-producing the same information over and over in a bunch of different places. We need a properly tagged database, so that the information displayed is adjusted depending upon my query.. 


### A Machine Readable Repository on Every Subject In Crypto.

Originally organized in the channels of a [discord server](http://crypt0library.net), this is a landing pad in the process of making a machine readable repository of information on every subject in crypto.

* [Source⧉Crypto](https://discord.gg/ahTuPMY) - I collect and categorize links in here, on the fly.

* [infominer33/SourceCrypto](https://github.com/infominer33/SourceCrypto) - Later I enter the links into machine readable TOML format.

Even further down the line, those links get organized some more, and added to the human-readable .md files of various github repositories.

Now we're, here, and I'm building web-pages around all of it. I didn't plan it that way, but it's all coming together nicely. 

At some point, I will need an app (or a few scripts) to grab all links from the files in a repository, check them against our database, and output a list of links that need to be added.

## Source⧉Crypto Demo

This is a really basic demo that gives you some idea of the potential.

### Tagging

Tagging is a complex topic. We need enough unique tags to make this directory ideally navigable, and to use a consistent schema for tagging over the course of this project. If you are jumping in and getting involved, just tag as best you can, I'll be going over the tagging many times.

Once this project is living in a web app it will become a more streamlined collaborative process: so that tags can be suggested and also flagged as unhelpful. 

To be clear these are app specific tags that users will be able to create and navigate via. Not every possible keyword, that will come later on another layer.

See "[tag-definitions.md](/tag-definitions/)" for more information. Feel free to join in on the fun :)
