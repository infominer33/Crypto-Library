**Collecting and Cataloging Quality\Valuable Information, in conjunction with the SuperSource Discord chat.**{: .notice--success}

You may have noticed this site going through some transformations lately. You can now browse the contents of our discord server, right here from the comfort of this website.

* [Discord Index](http://infominer.id/SourceCrypto/discolog/)
  * [General](discolog/general/)
  * [Resources](discolog/resources/)
  * [Crypto](discolog/crypto/)
  * [Tech](discolog/tech/)
  * [Privacy](discolog/privacy/)
  * [Consensus](discolog/consensus/)
  * [Development](discolog/development/)
  * [Application](discolog/application/)

So, for now you can browse the entire index of channels at once, or one category at a time... later I will have a complete navigation index built. More info on how I did that, below.

## SourceCrypto

Source Crypto discord is a landing pad.. I drop links there on the fly, so those pages are not organized well, and maybe not all the links are 100% the best ever... Next will be to systematically go through and start building better, more organized resources built and driven by research.

The aim is to create a repository of information, generally mapping out the history and knowledge related to Bitcoin\blockchain.

So little by little, we'll map out the ecosystem of information around blockchain and cryptocurrencies, and those un-organized pages will grow to become each a formidible resource of its own.

The great thing is that gh-pages\jekyll are designed to generate content based upon structured data. So I'm a lot closer to the dream of creating a reasonably complete repository of knowledge related to crypto.

## A Machine Readable Repository on Every Subject In Crypto.


* [Source⧉Crypto](https://discord.gg/ahTuPMY) - I collect and categorize links in here, on the fly.

Previously, I was putting information in TOML format. Then, after I started to learn GitHub pages, and working with some other people on a similar project for Decentralized Identity, I realized that GitHub Pages \ Jekyll have built-in support for yaml, csv, and json... so, yaml is nice and we'll go with that. 

Recently, I found [Tyrrrz/DiscordChatExporter](https://github.com/Tyrrrz/DiscordChatExporter/issues/75) which quickly turned the entire contents of Source Crypto Discord Server into 170+ html files. 

Then, I used minimal-mistakes collections feature to quickly publish the lot of them, using VSCode to easily edit all of the files at the same time.

 That was a super quick and dirty way to get all that content up here on the web where anyone can access it more easily.


* [infominer33/SourceCrypto](https://github.com/infominer33/SourceCrypto) -  Now I have a few complete and proper toml files converted to json that I can use to experiment with generating pages - listing by title, tag, and incorporating search functionality, or perhaps filter by user-input.

I'm looking into ways to take a list of links and pull title description image automatically into yaml or json, and pages can be generated with jekyll.

Further down the line, each subject area will become the focus of its own landing page with well researched information, building with and from the structured data. Compared to currently we've got whatever I've happened upon in my travels of the web, with some contributions from the community, with a focus on history and identity.

I didn't exactly plan for things to work as they have, but everything I've been doing has naturally built upon what I've been working towards, and it's all coming together nicely.

## Tagging

[tag-definitions.md](/tag-definitions/) is where I was working on my idea of tagging.

@MaciekLaskus suggested:
>this is very interesting, but I think you're making a fundamental mistake with tagging this by topics

>what's really missing is tagging all of these resources by authors, co-authors, references/citations

> Maciek (April NYC & SF; May LA)
 once this is done, topical tags can be derived algorithmically
