**A discord server and web-portal for creating an open-source database of Crypto Knowledge.**


The Source Crypto discord server is a landing pad.. I drop links there on the fly, and the channels aren't perfectly organized, and maybe a few of the links are 100% the best ever... 

The next, and gradual step, will be to systematically build better, more organized web-resources using the sources gathered as a starting point.

The aim is to generally map out the history and knowledge related to Bitcoin\blockchain.

So, little by little, those un-organized pages will grow to become each a formidible resource of its own.

Previously, I was putting information in TOML format. Then, after I started to learn GitHub pages, and working with some other people on a similar project for Decentralized Identity, I realized that GitHub Pages \ Jekyll have built-in support for yaml, csv, and json... so, yaml is nice and we'll go with that. 

Recently, I found [Tyrrrz/DiscordChatExporter](https://github.com/Tyrrrz/DiscordChatExporter/issues/75) which quickly turned the entire contents of Source Crypto Discord Server into 170+ html files. 

Then, I used minimal-mistakes collections feature to quickly publish the lot of them, using VSCode to easily edit all of the files at the same time.

That was a super quick and dirty way to get all that content up here on the web where anyone can access it more easily.


* [infominer33/SourceCrypto](https://github.com/infominer33/SourceCrypto) -  Now I have a few complete and proper toml files converted to json that I can use to experiment with generating pages - listing by title, tag, and incorporating search functionality, or perhaps filter by user-input.

I'm looking into ways to take a list of links and pull title description image automatically into yaml or json, and pages can be generated with jekyll.

Further down the line, each subject area will become the focus of its own landing page with well researched information, building with and from the structured data. Compared to currently we've got whatever I've happened upon in my travels of the web, with some contributions from the community, with a focus on history and identity.

## Tagging

[tag-definitions.md](/tag-definitions/) is where I was working on my idea of tagging.

@MaciekLaskus suggested:
>this is very interesting, but I think you're making a fundamental mistake with tagging this by topics
>
>what's really missing is tagging all of these resources by authors, co-authors, references/citations once this is done, topical tags can be derived algorithmically
