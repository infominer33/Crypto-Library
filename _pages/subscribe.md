I'm taking a step back from social media, so I can focus better on creating informative resources, and curated collections.

If you'd like an e-mail for site updates and major announcements, you can subscribe here.

Eventually, I might experient with a monthly newsletter with an occasional promotional offer. However, that would be a distinct and separate opt-in list.
