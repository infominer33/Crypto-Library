I'm taking a step back from social media, so I can focus better on creating informative resources, and curated collections.

If you'd like an e-mail for site updates and major announcements, you can subscribe here.

I won't sell your information, or even send many e-mails.

Eventually, I might experient with a monthly newsletter with an occasional promotional offer. However, that would be a distinct opt-in list.

    <form method="POST" action="https://kwes.io/api/foreign/forms/jkYmOb8OJAVfi2S1qfWU" success-message="Thank You!" error-message="Oops! Your form has errors.">
        <label for="addy"> Email</label>
        <input type="email" name="addy" rules="required|email|max:255">
        <button type="submit">Submit</button>
