I started with whatever I had come across over the past year, and saved. Then I went to lopp.net, bitcoin.org, and few of the other of the top Bitcoin resources, such as LNRoute. I've gone through those sites gathering a link at a time, to sort them all in an iterative process, figuring out categories as I go. Then I got into the Awesome lists, and really started feeling like I had surveyed a broad swath of the Bitcoin information ecosystem. That's when I dove face first into the [Bitcoin Topic on Github](https://github.com/topics/bitcoin). 

As far as finding practical applcations interacting with Bitcoin in some way, it's hard to find a more comprehensive source than that. I'm still not through the entire list.. and since my Bitcoin History repo only has 4 stars, I will have to sroll through to the very bottom where I'm sure some other gems are found. 

I won't be able to list all of the practical Bitcoin links I've found here, so at the end, I'll share a link to where I'm collecting and organizing.

## You MUST Do Your Own Research

This is intended to be a starting point for anyone who is interested in using Bitcoin code \ hardware. These guides and tutorials are a great jumping off point, from which you can explore a variety of technologies you may not even have known were available.

Please. Do your own research.

There may be newer materials or advisaries for any of the following projects. Be sure to have a look around for additional information, rather than relying entirely upon this "hastily crafted" essay.

## Wallets

* [lopp.net - Recommended Wallets](https://www.lopp.net/bitcoin-information/recommended-wallets.html)
  > * Do not use wallets that don't give you recovery data; these wallets are likely controlling your keys.
  > * Do not use paper wallets unless you're an advanced user who understands all the risks.
  > * Do not store large amounts of value in single signature wallets.
  > * Make sure your heirs know how to recover your wallets without you!
  >
  >Note that it is NOT recommended that novices use the Bitcoin Core wallet. If you want to use a wallet backed by a fully validating node you run, read [Securing Your Financial Sovereignty](https://blog.lopp.net/securing-your-financial-sovereignty/).

## [Running a Bitcoin Full Node](https://www.lopp.net/bitcoin-information/full-node.html)

>While managing your own keys ensures that you can't lose your money due to the negligence or maliciousness of a custodian, running a full node ensures that you can't be tricked into accepting invalid bitcoin payments.
