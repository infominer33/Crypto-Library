  > "The history of Bitcoin has been a turbulent one to say the least, and right now we're in one of the most turbulent periods in its history, as it has spent the entirety of 2018 falling further and further from its peak value of nearly $20,000 in December 2017.\n\nBut something as uncertain as Bitcoin (and cryptocurrency in general) was never going to be smooth sailing. Many tried a cryptographed digital currency before it, and they weren't able to fully crack it. Since Bitcoin became a reality nearly a decade ago, there have been some high highs and some low lows. For some Bitcoin owners, that's part of the appeal.\n\nBut how did we get to where we are today with Bitcoin? How did it begin, what were its forebearers, and what have been the unexpected turns of the Bitcoin journey? Let's take a walk through the timeline and find out."

The notion of a new currency, maintained by the computers of users around the world, has been the butt of many jokes, but that has not stopped it from growing into a technology worth billions of dollars, supported by the hordes of followers who have come to view it as the most important new idea since the creation of the Internet."

  > "Although it is widely believed that Satoshi was an inflation-hating goldbug he never said this, and in fact programmed Bitcoin's money supply to grow indefinitely, forever. He modeled the monetary supply as 4 gold mines being discovered per mibillenium (1024 years), with equal intervals between them, each one being depleted over the course of 140 years. This poses obvious problems, however. Prominent among them is the discussion on what to call 1 billion Bitcoin, which symbol color to use for it, and when wallet clients should switch to it by default. To combat this, this document proposes a controversial change: making Bitcoin's monetary supply finite."
