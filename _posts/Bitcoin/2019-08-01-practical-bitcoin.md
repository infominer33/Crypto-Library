Now that I've studied "the blockchain" for a couple years, it's getting easier to navigate this space.  Meanwhile, Bitcoin has proven its dominance, and I'm increasingly compelled to focus *a lot* more on acquiring practical experience, aiming towards a sovereign work-flow.

While there are already a number of excellent infomative lists, resources pages, and other collections, I haven't noticed any that focused specifically on *using* Bitcoin.

I began by sorting through the links I've collected over the past year, then scouring lopp.net, bitcoin.org, Bitcoin Only, LNRoute... "one link at a time", sorting them in an iterative process, until clear categories began to emerge.

Once I got into the Awesome lists, I felt like I had surveyed a broad swath of the practical Bitcoin info-systems. Next, I dove face first into the [Bitcoin Topic](https://github.com/topics/bitcoin) on Github. As far as practical applcations of Bitcoin, it's hard to find a more comprehensive source than that. I'm still not through the entire list.

## You MUST Do Your Own Research

This is intended to be a starting point for anyone who is interested in using Bitcoin code \ hardware. These guides and tutorials are a great jumping off point, from which you can explore a variety of technologies you may not even have known were available.

Please. Do your own research.

There may be newer materials or advisaries for any of these projects. Be sure to check for recent information to be sure it's something you really want to use.

[chris-belcher/electrum-personal-server](https://github.com/chris-belcher/electrum-personal-server)
> It is an implementation of the Electrum server protocol which fulfills the specific need of using the Electrum wallet backed by a full node, but without the heavyweight server backend, for a single user. It allows the user to benefit from all of Bitcoin Core's resource-saving features like pruning, blocksonly and disabled txindex. All of Electrum's feature-richness like hardware wallet integration, multisignature wallets, offline signing, seed recovery phrases, coin control and so on can still be used, but connected only to the user's own full node. Full node wallets are important in bitcoin because they are an big part of what makes the system be trustless. No longer do people have to trust a financial institution like a bank or paypal, they can run software on their own computers. If bitcoin is digital gold, then a full node wallet is your own personal goldsmith who checks for you that received payments are genuine. Full node wallets are also important for privacy. Using Electrum under default configuration requires it to send (hashes of) all your bitcoin addresses to some server. That server can then easily spy on your transactions. Full node wallets like Electrum Personal Server would download the entire blockchain and scan it for the user's own addresses, and therefore don't reveal to anyone else which bitcoin addresses they are interested in.

[docs.btcpayserver.org/deployment/thirdpartyhosting](https://docs.btcpayserver.org/deployment/thirdpartyhosting)
> Trusted third parties are security holes. By relying on someone else to manage a server for you, you are potentially exposing yourself to a certain attack vector. The most significant attack vector when using a third party host is that a malicious and technically skilled host can create a forked version of BTCPay Server and modify it so that it either spy on your transactions or replace your xpubkey with his. This means that future payments made to you may end up in a malicious party wallet.
>
> BTCPay does not allow server hosts to view the stores of other users nor have access to any personal data (except for registration email address). The xpubkey and even balances of other users can't be seen. However, as mentioned, a malicious third party could modify that by creating a fork that can look like BTCPay on the front but be something completely different in reality. The biggest concern, which happens when using a third-party host (even if the owner of a self-hosted server is not malicious) comes from the nature of the Bitcoin itself. If a user is not running a full node but instead relies on someone else's node, his transactions can be listened to by the owner of that node.
