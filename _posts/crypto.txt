[BlockChain Technology - Beyond Bitcoin](https://scet.berkeley.edu/wp-content/uploads/BlockchainPaper.pdf)
  > A blockchain is essentially a distributed database of records or public ledger of all transactions or
digital events that have been executed and shared among participating parties. Each transaction in
the public ledger is verified by consensus of a majority of the participants in the system. And, once
entered, information can never be erased. The blockchain contains a certain and verifiable record of
every single transaction ever made. Bitcoin, the decentralized peer­to­peer digital currency, is the
most popular example that uses blockchain technology. The digital currency bitcoin itself is highly
controversial but the underlying blockchain technology has worked flawlessly and found wide range of
applications in both financial and non­financial world.

[FRAGMENTED TRANSACTION PROTOCOL](http://diyhpl.us/~bryan/papers2/bitcoin/tom_oct17.txt) - Tom Elvis Jedusor - 17 October, 2018
  > A protocol is presented, to obsfucate transaction amounts until the moment the coin is spent. In general only the receivers know each other's amounts. They prove this by revealing hash preimages, ownership of whose encodes the fragmented transaction amounts. The script in fragmented transaction is hashed and opaque, not subject to validation by network nodes. This makes this proposal well suited for future improvements in the area such as using zero knowledge proofs or secure multiparty computation that could prove the equation input = sum of outputs to each member of the anonymity group. These future improvements could cause it so that the each others amounts would not be known even by the actual members of the anonymity group.

[Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerance](http://pmg.csail.mit.edu/papers/osdi99.pdf) Miguel Castro and Barbara Liskov
  > This paper describes a new replication algorithm that is able to tolerate Byzantine faults. We believe that Byzantinefault-tolerant algorithms will be increasingly important in the future because malicious attacks and software errors are increasingly common and can cause faulty nodes to exhibit arbitrary behavior. Whereas previous algorithms assumed a synchronous system or were too slow to be used in practice, the algorithm described in this paper is practical: it works in asynchronous environments like the Internet and incorporates several important optimizations that improve the response time of previous algorithms by more than an order of magnitude. We implemented a Byzantine-fault-tolerant NFS service using our algorithm and measured its performance. The results show that ourservice is only 3% slower than a standard unreplicated NFS
