## Smart Contracts

* [LeastAuthority/ethereum-analyses/GasEcon.md](https://github.com/LeastAuthority/ethereum-analyses/blob/master/GasEcon.md)
  > Ethereum supports computationally-rich contracts, written in a Turing-complete language. This enables a previously-unavailable variety of self-enforcing "smart contracts", where all parties involved can be confident that their funds will be used in a predictable fashion.
  > 
  > The downside of this increased flexibility is a new set of costs and threats for the miners and verifiers which execute these programs. Turing-complete programs cannot in general be statically analyzed to determine runtime or resource costs (storage, stack depth, etc). Programs which deliberately (or accidentally) get stuck in an infinite loop have the potential to stall the machine executing it. Programs which are merely complex or CPU-intensive still might "cost" more than the miner is willing to bear.

* [Hunting the Ethereum Smart Contract: Color-inspired Inspection of Potential Attacks](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1807.01868.pdf)
  > Blockchain and Cryptocurrencies are gaining unprecedented popularity and understanding. Meanwhile, Ethereum is gaining a significant popularity in the blockchain community, mainly due to the fact that it is designed in a way that enables developers to write smart contract and decentralized applications (Dapps). This new paradigm of applications opens the door to many possibilities and opportunities. However, the security of Ethereum smart contracts has not received much attention; several Ethereum smart contracts malfunctioning have recently been reported. Unlike many previous works that have applied static and dynamic analyses to find bugs in smart contracts, we do not attempt to define and extract any features; instead we focus on reducing the expert’s labor costs. We first present a new in-depth analysis of potential attacks methodology and then translate the bytecode of solidity into RGB color code. After that, we transform them to a fixed-sized encoded image. Finally, the encoded image is fed to convolutional neural network (CNN) for automatic feature extraction and learning, detecting compiler bugs of Ethereum smart contract.
