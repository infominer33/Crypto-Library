  > A STO offering is generally not appropriate for a small-cap raise (under $5M) as the expenses involved do not easily scale. There are also significant up-front costs from a variety of vendors placing an STO out of reach for all but the best-funded startups. Your investment is also at risk if the offering fails to meet its funding goal.

* [https://www.sec.gov/corpfin/framework-investment-contract-analysis-digital-assets](https://www.sec.gov/corpfin/framework-investment-contract-analysis-digital-assets)
  > If you are considering an Initial Coin Offering, sometimes referred to as an "ICO," or otherwise engaging in the offer, sale, or distribution of a digital asset,[2] you need to consider whether the U.S. federal securities laws apply. A threshold issue is whether the digital asset is a "security" under those laws.[3] The term "security" includes an "investment contract," as well as other instruments such as stocks, bonds, and transferable shares. A digital asset should be analyzed to determine whether it has the characteristics of any product that meets the definition of "security" under the federal securities laws. In this guidance, we provide a framework for analyzing whether a digital asset has the characteristics of one particular type of security – an "investment contract."[4] Both the Commission and the federal courts frequently use the "investment contract" analysis to determine whether unique or novel instruments or arrangements, such as digital assets, are securities subject to the federal securities laws.

  > Can cryptocurrencies wrest some control away from central banks and traditional financial players, and disrupt the market as we know it? The potential is certainly there! While blockchain empowered digital currencies are far from mature, their disruption of the current financial system is inevitable. Cryptocurrencies are creating a money revolution. By making some intermediary functions redundant, they call into question the paradigm of traditional fiat currencies and the role of central banks and financial institutions. However, central banks and other influential financial sector players around the globe can certainly play a major role in shaping this landscape. In response to this new paradigm, central banks and financial institutions are experimenting with, and prototyping their own cryptocurrencies

  > Keep in mind that you must raise funding from “accredited investors” for the Form D exemption to apply as noted in Rule 506 of Regulation D . These are investors who usually earn over $200,000 a year or are worth at least $1 million. You can also offer securities to companies worth at least $5 million. By either registering with the SEC or filing Form D, a business has taken the time to show they're not providing an illegal public offering.

* [Form D: Everything You Need to Know](https://www.upcounsel.com/form-d)
  > Form D is a filing with the SEC that allows companies under Regulation D or Section 4(6) exemption to offer stock to finance businesses without doing an IPO.
* [The Definitive Guide to Regulation D - WealthForge](https://www.wealthforge.com/understanding-regulation-d)
  > While Regulation D offerings are exempt from registration with the SEC, both the SEC and the various states require filings providing notice that an offering is occurring. The SEC requires an issuer to file notice on Form D within 15 days of the date of first sale of a Reg D security on the SEC's Edgar System. Form D contains basic information about the offering and the issuer, including industry, whether a broker-dealer is involved, and the amount being raised. In addition, for each state into which the security is sold, the issuer must file a notice filing within 15 days of the first sale in that state. The majority of states use an online database to allow electronic filing. Additionally, with this notice filing, the states require the issuer to pay a filing fee, usually between $100-$500.

* [Rule 506 of Regulation D - Investor.gov](https://www.investor.gov/additional-resources/general-resources/glossary/rule-506-regulation-d)
  > Rule 506 of Regulation D provides two distinct exemptions from registration for companies when they offer and sell securities. Companies relying on the Rule 506 exemptions can raise an unlimited amount of money. Under Rule 506(b), a “safe harbor” under Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act, a company can be assured it is within the Section 4(a)(2) exemption by satisfying certain requirements, including the following: The company cannot use general solicitation or advertising to market the securities. The company may sell its securities to an unlimited number of "accredited investors" and up to 35 other purchasers. All non-accredited investors, either alone or with a purchaser representative, must be sophisticated—that is, they must have sufficient knowledge and experience in financial and business matters to make them capable of evaluating the merits and risks of the prospective investment. Companies must decide what information to give to accredited investors, so long as it does not violate the antifraud prohibitions of the federal securities laws. This means that any information a company provides to investors must be free from false or misleading statements. Similarly, a company should not exclude any information if the omission makes what is provided to investors false or misleading. Companies must give non-accredited investors disclosure documents that are generally the same as those used in Regulation A or registered offerings, including financial statements, which in some cases may need to be certified or audited by an accountant. If a company provides information to accredited investors, it must make this information available to non-accredited investors as well. The company must be available to answer questions by prospective purchasers.

  > According to this market participant, marketing costs tend to vary by issuer, totaling up to 20% of the target offering amount. For example, a high-quality videographer usually costs about $2,000-$5,000 dollars. This is not surprising, given that another industry study has documented the importance of having a high-quality video for the success of a crowdfunding campaign.65 Also according to this market participant, bank and transaction fees also may vary depending on the type of back-end infrastructure developed by the intermediary and the type of securities offered (e.g., equity vs. debt). Some fees, such as transfer agent fees, could be on an annual basis, while others could be on a per-investor basis. One intermediary responding to the look-back survey also estimated that issuers spent approximately three to four weeks to prepare their Form C. Additionally, this intermediary stated that most issuers use cash accounting and spent thousands of dollars both to prepare financial statements that instead comply with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“U.S. GAAP”) and then to have those financial statements reviewed or audited by an independent auditor.

While we can see that this will be the first step in standardizing token offerings under Regulation A+, we also see that there are a number of legal, business and operational issues that any token sponsor will need to address in what will inevitably be a “not as easy as advertised” process with the SEC.

Regulation A is not available to: - companies registered or required to be registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940 and BDCs; - development stage companies that have no specific business plan or purpose or have indicated that their business plan is to engage in a merger or acquisition with an unidentified company or companies (often referred to as, “blank check companies”); - issuers of fractional undivided interests in oil or gas rights, or similar interests in other mineral rights; - issuers that are required to, but that have not, filed with the Commission the ongoing reports required by the rules under Regulation A during the two years immediately preceding the filing of a new offering statement (or for such shorter period that the issuer was required to file such reports); - issuers that are or have been subject to an order by the Commission denying, suspending, or revoking the registration of a class of securities pursuant to Section 12(j) of the Exchange Act that was entered within five years before the filing of the offering statement; and - issuers subject to “bad actor” disqualification under Rule 262. The final rules limit the types of securities eligible for sale under Regulation A to the specifically enumerated list in Section 3(b)(3) of the Securities Act, which includes warrants and convertible equity and debt securities, among other equity and debt securities.

Seeing as the majority of security offerings target US investors, a veteran lawyer can be the crucial difference between a successful raise and a subpoena from the SEC — ultimately killing your business dead in its tracks. Your lawyer will be responsible for regulatory filings (Reg D, Reg A+, Reg S or CF), collateral compliance and the proper disclosure of offering terms including but not limited to participation rights and warrants. Generally speaking, the filings and retainer will be the most expensive upfront costs for a security token offering.

  > Cryptocurrencies and initial coin offerings (ICO) are all the rage in startup financing. Until mid-2017, these ICOs existed in a wild west environment, a regulatory limbo, with some companies raising hundreds of millions of dollars in days and others crashing and burning in the same amount of time. Like Wyatt Earp in Dodge City, the Securities and Exchange Commission declared its jurisdiction over these ICOs, laying down the law in the “DAO Report” with the legal equivalent of a double barrel shotgun. The SEC was right to do so. There is no doubt that the overwhelming majority of ICOs involve the sale of securities and companies who ignore this conclusion do so at their own risk. Yet the law of ICOs and digital token financing is by no means final or clear, and with little official guidance to go on, startups are left to fend for themselves in a sea of self-declared experts. Few scholarly articles to date have addressed the regulatory status of these ICOs from a securities law perspective. This article provides a legal framework and method for analysis in the aggressive, case-by-case approach laid down by the SEC in the DAO Report, and recommends best practices for companies considering an ICO to follow

Such as the Securities and Exchange Act, Reg S and the recent JOBS Act changes should be required reading for startup CEOs raising money. Sure, you won’t get all the case law nor the later additions, but you’ll understand what the overall framework is. Then you can discuss specifics with a lawyer. Also if you’re a startup, some lawyers may take an advisor equity in exchange for 4 hours a month or so.

An obscure but very useful fact is that non-equity securities do not have a limit on how many investors you can have, before you must become a publicly reporting company. And selling to NON US investors they may be able to trade your securities after 40 days. However, their local jurisdiction may have other ideas, and this is one of those areas where you can either try to abide by all local laws in theory, or in practice take advantage of the fact that, in early stages, governments of foreign jurisdictions aren’t going to waste too much political capital on long-arm actions to go after US corporations because they failed to prevent an overseas investor from selling their securities early.

  > Blockchain startups waiting for approvals from U.S. securities regulators are getting restless, and wondering what’s the holdup. The Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA), Wall Street’s self-regulatory organization (SRO), has sat for months on some 40 applications from companies that touch cryptocurrencies, numerous people who deal with the agency told CoinDesk. Some startups have been waiting at least a year, with a few standing by for as many as 14 months, without seeing any movement from FINRA, three of the sources said.

* [Electronic Cash, Decentralized Exchange, and the Constitution](https://coincenter.org/files/e-cash-dex-constitution.pdf) Peter Van Valkenburgh
  > Regulators, law enforcement, and the general public have come to expect that cryptocurrencytransactions will leave a public record on a blockchain, and that most cryptocurrency exchangeswill take place using centralized businesses that are regulated and surveilled through the BankSecrecy Act. The emergence of electronic cash and decentralized exchange software challengesthese expectations. Transactions need not leave any public record and exchanges can beaccomplished peer to peer without using a regulated third party in between. Faced withdiminished visibility into cryptocurrency transactions, policymakers may propose newapproaches to financial surveillance. Regulating cryptocurrency software developers andindividual users of that software under the Bank Secrecy Act would be unconstitutional underthe Fourth Amendment because it would be a warrantless search and seizure of informationprivate to cryptocurrency users. Furthermore, any law or regulation attempting to ban, requirelicensing for, or compel the altered publication (​e.g.​ backdoors) of cryptocurrency softwarewould be unconstitutional under First Amendment protections for speech.

  > Peer-to-Peer: Services like LocalBitcoins or OTC trading, are still MSBs if the buyer or seller is advertising the services and/or making a profit from either crypto-to-crypto or fiat-to-crypto exchanges. CVC Wallets: A new four-factor test is created to determine if a wallet provider needs to register as an MSB: (a) who owns the value; (b) where the value is stored; (c) whether the owner interacts directly with the payment system where the CVC runs; and (d) whether the person acting as the intermediary has total independent control over the value.

  >...
  >
  > Trading Platforms and DEXs: “Under FinCEN regulations, a person is exempt from money transmitter status if the person only provides the delivery, communication, or network access services used by a money transmitter to support the money transmission services.” So if you only provide a forum where buyers and sellers of CVC post their bids and offers (with or without auto-matching of counterparties), and the parties match through an outside venue (individual wallet or other wallet not hosted by the trading platform), the trading platform does not qualify as a money transmitter under FinCEN. If, when the match takes place, a trading platform purchases from the seller and sells to the buyer, it’s a CVC exchanger and thus falls under the definition of money transmitter.
