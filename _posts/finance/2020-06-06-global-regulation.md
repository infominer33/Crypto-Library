  > Crypto-assets,1 such as bitcoin2 and ether, reached an estimated total market capitalisation of $830 billion on 8 January 2018, before falling sharply in subsequent months. These markets remain small compared to the global financial system, and crypto-assets are not yet widely used for financial transactions, but markets are changing rapidly. The growth of crypto-asset trading platforms (often misleadingly called ‘exchanges’);3 the introduction of new financial products (such as crypto-asset funds and trusts and exchange-traded products); and the growing interest by retail investors, raise questions about the implications of crypto-assets for financial stability.

  > Open-source library of relevant token project data serves as a “single source of truth.”Disclosures provided by projects and validated by the system of validating token-holders.Platform ensures updates are disseminated publicly to a wide audience in a timely fashion.Self-regulatory mechanism ensures reporting requirements are met & only compliant projects admitted.Registry value may increase as the quality of the underlying data and registry size increases.How the Registry Works The crypto markets are more opaque and complicated to navigate than traditional asset classes. Data inf rastructure is poor, standardized disclosures are non-existent, and incentives can be misaligned. There are no standardized formats or channels for token projects to share essential information with their communities and stakeholders. Enforcing transparency standards amongst token projects presents a global coordination problem with significant bootstrapping challenges. Absent the authority of a government-sanctioned regulator, does crypto have the necessary tools to self-regulate?

  > Messari, the leading provider of contextualized data and research tools for the cryptoasset industry, launched its open-source disclosures registry today. They are joined by a diverse, reputable group of 12 initial partner projects committed to transparency and self-regulation. Messari’s registry aims to become a single source of truth for basic cryptoasset information. Participating projects are voluntarily disclosing basic information regarding their token design, supply details, technology audits, official communication channels, and relevant team members, investors, and advisors. These profiles can then be f reely accessed industry-wide, providing a reliable, standardized resource to industry participants that is nonexistent today. Such basic data standards can facilitate diligence processes for crypto service providers like exchanges and wallets, retail and professional investors, and regulators alike.

Now the race is on to become the go-to destination for cryptocurrency companies that are looking for shelter from regulatory uncertainty in the United States and Asia. In small countries and territories including Bermuda, Malta, Gibraltar and Liechtenstein, officials have recently passed laws, or have legislation in the works, to make themselves more welcoming to cryptocurrency companies and projects. In Malta, the government passed three laws on July 4 so companies can easily issue new cryptocurrencies and trade existing ones. In Bermuda this year, the legislature passed a law that lets start-ups doing initial coin offerings apply to the minister of finance for speedy approval.

* [What is MiFID - The Markets in Financial Instruments Directive ?](https://complyadvantage.com/knowledgebase/regulation/mifid/)
  > There are several key aspects of MiFID that are meant to aid the regulation of the financial industry. One of these is the requirement of client categorization. Due to MiFID, firms are required to place their clients into categories in order to determine the level of protection that is needed with their types of accounts and investments. MiFID also requires that firms abide by both pre-trade and post-trade transparency. Pre-trade transparency means that those who operate order-matching systems must make information regarding the five best pricing levels (on both buy and sell side) available to all. Similarly, those who run quote-driven markets must make the best bids and offers publicly available. Post-trade transparency is a similar concept, but differs slightly. By requiring post-trade transparency, MiFID requires that firms release information regarding the price, time, and volume of all trades pertaining to listed shares, even if they are not executed in an open market scenario. There are certain circumstances where deferred publication may be granted, but that varies from case to case and must be dealt with on an individual level.

  > How do I know if my token is a Specified Investment? Given the complexity of many tokens, it is not always easy to determine whether a token is a Specified Investment, specifically those types of Specified Investment that are securities, like shares or debt instruments. There are a few factors that are indicative of a security. 
  > These factors may include, but are not limited to:
  > • the contractual rights and obligations the token-holder has by virtue of holding or owning that cryptoasset
  > • any contractual entitlement to profit-share (like dividends), revenues, or other payment or benefit of any kind 
  > • any contractual entitlement to ownership in, or control of, the token issuer or other relevant person (like voting rights)
  > • the language used in relevant documentation, like token ‘whitepapers’, that suggests the tokens are intended to function as an investment, although it should be noted that the substance of the token will determine whether an instrument is a Specified Investment, and not necessarily the labels used–For example, if a whitepaper declares a token to be a utility token, but the contractual rights that it confers would make it a Specified Investment, we would consider it to be a security token.
  > • whether the token is transferable and tradeable on cryptoasset exchanges or any other type of exchange or market
  > • a direct flow of payment from the issuer or other relevant party to token holders may be one of the indicators that the token is a security, although an indirect flow of payment (for instance through profits or payments derived exclusively from the secondary market) would not necessarily indicate the contrary.

* [How will new regulation affect the crypto market?](https://www2.deloitte.com/nl/nl/pages/risk/articles/how-will-new-regulation-affect-the-crypto-market.html)
  > There are, however, some reservations about the proposed law. The rules for companies dealing with cryptocurrencies have now become as strict as those applying to banks. Even if someone wants to buy only 10 euro worth of Bitcoin, an exchange must ask for identification. This seems excessive, especially if the person is already identified through the Dutch bank account they are using to pay. If the law is strictly interpreted — which is often the case shortly after a law’s introduction — then it could possibly overshoot its goal. It makes sense that companies dealing with large amounts of cryptocurrency must be thoroughly investigated. But if every individual with a small crypto wallet has to be identified as a high-risk customer, this will lead to the creation of large databases of personal data that bring about other, disproportional risks. In addition, a strict interpretation of the law might potentially slow down further innovation in the Dutch crypto market. Fortunately, Dutch regulators are willing to start conversations with cryptocurrency companies, as demonstrated by the sandbox environment provided for blockchain companies by the DNB and AFM. This demonstrates a willingness to start a dialogue with cryptocurrency companies in the hopes of achieving a risk-based approach to the new regulations.

One Hong Kong-based company last year first moved its official company domain to the Indian Ocean island of Mauritius. It then sold a token from a limited liability company in the Cayman Islands, which was in turn wholly owned by a trust in the island-nation of St Kitts and Nevis. However, such elaborate means of avoiding regulatory scrutiny have since gone out of style in the legal sector, Ms Ng says. Inquiries about STOs have surged this year, she adds, indicating that the future of cryptocurrencies is more likely to play out in regulatory daylight."

* [The development of laws on electronic documents and e-commerce transactions / Alysia Davies](http://publications.gc.ca/site/eng/9.829417/publication.html)
  > "Electronic commerce has had a dramatic impact on the way in which business is done. Increasingly, business communications are being conducted online, as businesses adapt their operations to an electronic environment. In a new business environment where electronic transactions have become the norm, the use of paper to document business transactions is becoming less important. In fact, one of the benefits of conducting business by using digitized information is that it obviates the need to transmit and store paper. Although businesses are adapting to the electronic environment, legal rules continue to stipulate that certain transactions or documents be in writing. Many see such legal requirements as an impediment to transacting business electronically. It is argued that, with a few exceptions, there is little or no benefit in requiring that electronic transactions be put in written form and signed manually. Indeed, it is now widely recognized that legal requirements calling for written documents and manual signatures must somehow accommodate the world of electronic communications. This view has been the driving force behind efforts by international bodies and individual countries to develop rules which would give the same level of legal recognition to electronic transactions as is accorded to paper documents that perform the same function. This paper will review the development of legislation governing the use of electronic alternatives to paper-based forms of communication by the United Nations and in the United States, Australia, the European Union and Canada"--p.1.

Mr. Powers failed to register as a money services business (MSB), had no written policies or procedures for ensuring compliance with the BSA, and failed to report suspicious transactions and currency transactions.
* [Op Ed: Understanding the Latest FinCEN Guidance for Cryptocurrencies](https://bitcoinmagazine.com/articles/op-ed-understanding-latest-fincen-guidance-cryptocurrencies)
  > Peer-to-Peer: Services like LocalBitcoins or OTC trading, are still MSBs if the buyer or seller is advertising the services and/or making a profit from either crypto-to-crypto or fiat-to-crypto exchanges. CVC Wallets: A new four-factor test is created to determine if a wallet provider needs to register as an MSB: (a) who owns the value; (b) where the value is stored; (c) whether the owner interacts directly with the payment system where the CVC runs; and (d) whether the person acting as the intermediary has total independent control over the value.
* [Application of FinCEN’s Regulations to Certain Business Models Involving Convertible Virtual Currencies](https://www.systems.cs.cornell.edu/docs/fincen-cvc-guidance-final.pdf)
  > The Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) is issuing this interpretive guidance to remind persons subject to the Bank Secrecy Act (BSA) how FinCEN regulations relating to money services businesses (MSBs) apply to certain business models1 involving money transmission denominated in value that substitutes for currency, specifically, convertible virtual currencies (CVCs).2 This guidance does not establish any new regulatory expectations or requirements. Rather, it consolidates current FinCEN regulations, and related administrative rulings and guidance issued since 2011, and then applies these rules and interpretations to other common business models involving CVC engaging in the same underlying patterns of activity.
* [Application of FinCEN’s Regulations to Certain Business Models Involving Convertible Virtual Currencies](https://www.fincen.gov/sites/default/files/2019-05/FinCEN%2520CVC%2520Guidance%2520FINAL.pdf) - May 2019
  > Lastly, a person who is engaged in more than one type of business model at the same time may be subject to more than one type of regulatory obligation or exemption. For example, a developer or seller of either a software application or a new CVC platform may be exempt from BSA obligations associated with creating or selling the application or CVC platform, but may still have BSA obligations as a money transmitter if the seller or developer also uses the new application to engage as a business in accepting and transmitting currency, funds, or value that substitutes for currency, or uses the new platform to engage as a business in accepting and transmitting the new CVC. Likewise, an exemption may apply to a person performing a certain role in the development or sale of a software application, while a different person using the same application to accept and transmit currency, funds, or value that substitutes for currency would be still subject to BSA obligations.
  >
  > FinCEN’s regulations define the term “money transmitter” to include a “person that provides money transmission services,” or “any other person engaged in the transfer of funds.”7 A “transmittor,” on the other hand, is “[t]he sender of the first transmittal order in a transmittal of funds. The term transmittor includes an originator, except where the transmittor’s financial institution is a financial institution or foreign financial agency other than a bank or foreign bank.”8

  > In other words, a **transmittor** *initiates* a transaction that the **money transmitter** actually *executes*.

He also says, "who cares?" about the US dollar losing global reserve status, pointing out that many prosperous countries have currencies that don't function as global reserves. He tells us how he would design a central bank digital currency, and why, even if central banks enabled citizens to open accounts with them, thus bypassing commercial banks, it wouldn't drive banks out of business. We also cover how that could affect fractional reserve banking and credit creation, the People's Bank of China's soon-to-be-issued digital yuan, and why blockchains haven't yet substantially helped the unbanked, as they were originally touted to do.

  > In the midst of the technological renaissance we are living through, what then is the proper role of the regulator?  I believe it starts with leadership, clarity, cooperation, and open-mindedness.  I think it is incumbent upon regulators to create a workable and appropriate regulatory framework that facilitates market-enhancing innovation.  This means adopting regulation that is fair, technology-neutral, and does not stifle positive innovations.  It means actively engaging with the financial technology (FinTech) community and other regulators to provide the regulatory certainty necessary to support innovation that promotes competition, vibrancy, and growth in our financial markets.  It also means developing thoughtful, balanced regulation that allows nascent markets to develop while also protecting investors and preserving market integrity.

  > In order to further these objectives, the CFTC is engaging with industry to learn more about FinTech, through the LabCFTC initiative and the Technology Advisory Committee (TAC).  Chairman Giancarlo and the agency launched LabCFTC in the spring of 2017.  Through early engagement during the development process, LabCFTC hopes to offer clarity and guidance about the CFTC’s regulatory framework.

Transactions need not leave any public record and exchanges can beaccomplished peer to peer without using a regulated third party in between. Faced withdiminished visibility into cryptocurrency transactions, policymakers may propose newapproaches to financial surveillance. Regulating cryptocurrency software developers andindividual users of that software under the Bank Secrecy Act would be unconstitutional underthe Fourth Amendment because it would be a warrantless search and seizure of informationprivate to cryptocurrency users. Furthermore, any law or regulation attempting to ban, requirelicensing for, or compel the altered publication (​e.g.​ backdoors) of cryptocurrency softwarewould be unconstitutional under First Amendment protections for speech.

* [Why You Should Worry About Blue Sky Filings](https://www.wealthforge.com/insights/why-you-should-be-worrying-about-blue-sky-filings)

  > Since the passage of the NSMIA, 92 percent of all private securities offerings greater than $1 million have been conducted under the more daunting Rule 506, which is exempt from blue-sky registration requirements, and not Rules 504 or 505, which remain subject to blue sky requirements. State anti-fraud provisions still apply to all offerings. This demonstrates the clear preference of securities issuers and investors for certainty and consistency in securities regulation, as they flock to SEC safe harbors that require compliance with only one uniform set of rules, and away from those that require compliance with more than 50 separate sets of rules.

  > The Pennsylvania Department of Banking and Securities (“DoBS”) has received multiple inquiries from entities engaged in various forms of virtual currency exchanges. As the DoBS will not be responding to these requests for guidance on a case-by-case basis, the DoBS is providing the following guidance on the applicability of the Money Transmission Business Licensing Law, otherwise known as the Money Transmitter Act (“MTA”), to virtual currency exchanges.

* [State Regulations on Virtual Currency and Blockchain Technologies](https://www.carltonfields.com/insights/publications/2018/state-regulations-on-virtual-currency-and-blockchain-technologies)
  > There exists no uniformity with respect to how businesses that deal in virtual currencies (also known as "cryptocurrencies") such as Bitcoin are treated among the states. For these proprietors, often the first question asked when deciding whether to operate within a state is whether existing state money transmitter rules apply to the sale or exchange of virtual currencies. As you will see from the discussion below, most states have not yet enacted regulations that provides virtual currency operators with any guidance on this question.

  > Wyoming’s money transmitter law exempts crypto-to-crypto transactions, effective as of last year. Many lawyers worry that Lightning Network transactions may run afoul of money transmitter laws. Well, not in Wyoming (#probably!—check with your lawyer!) At least three other states that I know of have either enacted, or are in process of enacting, Wyoming’s same money transmitter exemption for crypto-to-crypto transactions.

  > If you’re working on security tokens, you won’t find a friendlier state because Wyoming law legally recognizes both uncertificated and certificated blockchain shares of stock. Delaware was first to recognize blockchain shares, but it only recognizes uncertificated versions. Wyoming’s new law regarding certificated shares just took effect this week, and WOW, Missouri was lightning fast in already copying it!
* [https://www.wyoleg.gov/Legislation/2018/HB0070](https://www.wyoleg.gov/Legislation/2018/HB0070)
  > Wyoming was the first state to exempt utility tokens from its state securities laws, which took effect last year. State law doesn’t trump federal laws regarding securities, but I’m pleased that Arizona also enacted a similar law last year and five other states have proposed it this year.

  > One bill enables Wyoming’s electric utilities to negotiate directly with miners, instead of requiring them to go through the ratemaking process.

  > And, with a goal to help Wyoming’s struggling coal industry—which is crucial to Wyoming and is trying to recover from low coal prices—Wyoming passed a bill to provide a process for Wyoming’s electric utilities to sell the coal-fired generation plants they would otherwise permanently be shutting down. Potential buyers may include crypto miners, among others, and I’m told power costs available in Wyoming would be highly competitive with the best electricity prices available to miners around the world.

  > A bank license is superior to a trust company license for digital asset custody, for many reasons. Some have expressed concerns about triggering the Bank Holding Company Act (BHCA) by obtaining a Wyoming bank license, but a Wyoming special-purpose depository institution does not meet the definition of “bank” under the BHCA because it can’t make commercial loans. The US Supreme Court has rejected previous attempts by the Federal Reserve to expand this definition, so Wyoming's special-purpose depository institution is a pretty neat regulatory option for those wanting to become qualified custodians of digital assets.
