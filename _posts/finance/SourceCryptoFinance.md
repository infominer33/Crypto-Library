Exchanges must get licensed by their local authority, must meet all local laws and industry standards, and use an account verified by Google.

If you trade in more than one country, you’ll need a certification for each country you wish to advertise in, providing its a country approved by Google.

  > An ICO issuer using Rule 506(b) cannot use “general solicitation,”[167] such as advertising, to market its tokens.[168] This prohibition on general solicitation may rule out Rule 506(b) for ICO issuers because it limits the ability to market the ICO via the Internet to a large number of potential investors. Furthermore, if non-accredited investors are participating in the offering, the ICO issuer must provide them with disclosure similar to the type of information provided in registered public offerings, an unheard-of level of disclosure for an ICO.[169] Tokens purchased pursuant to Rule 506(b) would be exempt from state registration requirements, and investors who purchase tokens in a Rule 506(b) offering would receive restricted securities, meaning they are not freely tradable unless they are either registered or comply with a valid resale exemption such as Rule 144.[170]

  > The fairly new Rule 506(c) of Regulation D complements Rule 506(b). Unlike Rule 506(b), Rule 506(c) would allow ICO issuers to use general solicitation, including advertising, to market the ICO in the U.S.[171] However, all purchasers in the offering must be accredited investors, and the ICO issuer using Rule 506(c) must take reasonable steps to verify the accredited status of the investors purchasing the tokens[172] or risk enforcement action by the SEC.[173]

  > Enacted in 2012, the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act, or JOBS Act, is intended, among other things, to reduce barriers to capital formation, particularly for smaller companies. The JOBS Act requires the SEC to adopt rules amending existing exemptions from registration under the Securities Act of 1933 and creating new exemptions that permit issuers of securities to raise capital without SEC registration. On July 10, 2013, the SEC adopted amendments to Rule 506 of Regulation D and Rule 144A under the Securities Act to implement the requirements of Section 201(a) of the JOBS Act. The amendments are effective on September 23, 2013.

Our key criteria were: - Operates clearly inside an existing regulatory framework which can manage ICOs and is interested in working with crypto organisations. - Measures taken to ensure long-term security, through strong asset and liability protections. - Provides options for secure banking operations: bank accounts not severely limited for transfer in or out, and workable for operations not just assets. - Demonstrates acceptable business conduct, with a strong reputation. - And ideally demonstrates a strong community of developers, social organisations, service providers all in service of building new economies.

* [The Arwen Trading Protocols](https://arwen.io/whitepaper.pdf) - Ethan Heilman, Sebastien Lipmann, Sharon Goldberg - January 28, 2019 
  > The Arwen Trading Protocol is a layer-two blockhchainprotocol that allows traders to securely trade cryptocur-rencies at a centralized exchange, without ceding cus-tody of their coins to the exchange. Before trading be-gins, traders deposit their coins in an on-blockchain es-crow, rather than in the exchange’s wallet. The agent ofescrow is the blockchain itself. Each individual trade isbacked by the coins locked in escrow. Each trade is fast,because it happens off-blockchain, and secure, becauseatomic swaps prevent even a hacked exchange from tak-ing custody of a trader’s coins. Arwen is designed towork even with the “lowest common denominator” ofblockchains—namely Bitcoin-derived coins without Seg-Wit support. As a result, Arwen supports essentiallyall “Bitcoin-derived” coins, including BTC, LTC, BCH,ZEC as well as Ethereum and ERC-20 tokens.

Now the race is on to become the go-to destination for cryptocurrency companies that are looking for shelter from regulatory uncertainty in the United States and Asia.

In Malta, the government passed three laws on July 4 so companies can easily issue new cryptocurrencies and trade existing ones. In Bermuda this year, the legislature passed a law that lets start-ups doing initial coin offerings apply to the minister of finance for speedy approval.

Data inf rastructure is poor, standardized disclosures are non-existent, and incentives can be misaligned. There are no standardized formats or channels for token projects to share essential information with their communities and stakeholders. Enforcing transparency standards amongst token projects presents a global coordination problem with significant bootstrapping challenges. Absent the authority of a government-sanctioned regulator, does crypto have the necessary tools to self-regulate?

They are joined by a diverse, reputable group of 12 initial partner projects committed to transparency and self-regulation. Messari’s registry aims to become a single source of truth for basic cryptoasset information. Participating projects are voluntarily disclosing basic information regarding their token design, supply details, technology audits, official communication channels, and relevant team members, investors, and advisors. These profiles can then be f reely accessed industry-wide, providing a reliable, standardized resource to industry participants that is nonexistent today. Such basic data standards can facilitate diligence processes for crypto service providers like exchanges and wallets, retail and professional investors, and regulators alike.

  > Crypto-assets,1 such as bitcoin2 and ether, reached an estimated total market capitalisation of $830 billion on 8 January 2018, before falling sharply in subsequent months. These markets remain small compared to the global financial system, and crypto-assets are not yet widely used for financial transactions, but markets are changing rapidly. The growth of crypto-asset trading platforms (often misleadingly called ‘exchanges’);3 the introduction of new financial products (such as crypto-asset funds and trusts and exchange-traded products); and the growing interest by retail investors, raise questions about the implications of crypto-assets for financial stability.

  > How do I know if my token is a Specified Investment? Given the complexity of many tokens, it is not always easy to determine whether a token is a Specified Investment, specifically those types of Specified Investment that are securities, like shares or debt instruments. There are a few factors that are indicative of a security. 
  > These factors may include, but are not limited to:
  > • the contractual rights and obligations the token-holder has by virtue of holding or owning that cryptoasset
  > • any contractual entitlement to profit-share (like dividends), revenues, or other payment or benefit of any kind 
  > • any contractual entitlement to ownership in, or control of, the token issuer or other relevant person (like voting rights)
  > • the language used in relevant documentation, like token ‘whitepapers’, that suggests the tokens are intended to function as an investment, although it should be noted that the substance of the token will determine whether an instrument is a Specified Investment, and not necessarily the labels used–For example, if a whitepaper declares a token to be a utility token, but the contractual rights that it confers would make it a Specified Investment, we would consider it to be a security token.
  > • whether the token is transferable and tradeable on cryptoasset exchanges or any other type of exchange or market
  > • a direct flow of payment from the issuer or other relevant party to token holders may be one of the indicators that the token is a security, although an indirect flow of payment (for instance through profits or payments derived exclusively from the secondary market) would not necessarily indicate the contrary.

  > There are, however, some reservations about the proposed law. The rules for companies dealing with cryptocurrencies have now become as strict as those applying to banks. Even if someone wants to buy only 10 euro worth of Bitcoin, an exchange must ask for identification. This seems excessive, especially if the person is already identified through the Dutch bank account they are using to pay. If the law is strictly interpreted — which is often the case shortly after a law’s introduction — then it could possibly overshoot its goal. It makes sense that companies dealing with large amounts of cryptocurrency must be thoroughly investigated. But if every individual with a small crypto wallet has to be identified as a high-risk customer, this will lead to the creation of large databases of personal data that bring about other, disproportional risks. In addition, a strict interpretation of the law might potentially slow down further innovation in the Dutch crypto market. Fortunately, Dutch regulators are willing to start conversations with cryptocurrency companies, as demonstrated by the sandbox environment provided for blockchain companies by the DNB and AFM. This demonstrates a willingness to start a dialogue with cryptocurrency companies in the hopes of achieving a risk-based approach to the new regulations.

* [What is MiFID - The Markets in Financial Instruments Directive ?](https://complyadvantage.com/knowledgebase/regulation/mifid/)
  > There are several key aspects of MiFID that are meant to aid the regulation of the financial industry. One of these is the requirement of client categorization. Due to MiFID, firms are required to place their clients into categories in order to determine the level of protection that is needed with their types of accounts and investments. MiFID also requires that firms abide by both pre-trade and post-trade transparency. Pre-trade transparency means that those who operate order-matching systems must make information regarding the five best pricing levels (on both buy and sell side) available to all. Similarly, those who run quote-driven markets must make the best bids and offers publicly available. Post-trade transparency is a similar concept, but differs slightly. By requiring post-trade transparency, MiFID requires that firms release information regarding the price, time, and volume of all trades pertaining to listed shares, even if they are not executed in an open market scenario. There are certain circumstances where deferred publication may be granted, but that varies from case to case and must be dealt with on an individual level.

  > Start-ups have gone to some lengths to avoid such infractions by setting up their businesses in offshore jurisdictions. One Hong Kong-based company last year first moved its official company domain to the Indian Ocean island of Mauritius. It then sold a token from a limited liability company in the Cayman Islands, which was in turn wholly owned by a trust in the island-nation of St Kitts and Nevis. However, such elaborate means of avoiding regulatory scrutiny have since gone out of style in the legal sector, Ms Ng says. Inquiries about STOs have surged this year, she adds, indicating that the future of cryptocurrencies is more likely to play out in regulatory daylight."

Instead, they are exchanged via simple technical protocols for communication between participants, as well as a publicly shared ledger of transactions (the “blockchain”) that is updated by a decentralised network of “miners” via costly computations, ie “proof-of-work”.

One objection I’ve heard from attorneys is that Wyoming doesn’t have a special court for resolving complex business disputes like Delaware does. Well, Wyoming just solved that by setting up its own business court (“Chancery Court”) this year, details of which are:

Well, not in Wyoming (#probably!—check with your lawyer!) At least three other states that I know of have either enacted, or are in process of enacting, Wyoming’s same money transmitter exemption for crypto-to-crypto transactions.

Delaware was first to recognize blockchain shares, but it only recognizes uncertificated versions.

  > And, with a goal to help Wyoming’s struggling coal industry—which is crucial to Wyoming and is trying to recover from low coal prices—Wyoming passed a bill to provide a process for Wyoming’s electric utilities to sell the coal-fired generation plants they would otherwise permanently be shutting down. Potential buyers may include crypto miners, among others, and I’m told power costs available in Wyoming would be highly competitive with the best electricity prices available to miners around the world.

  > A bank license is superior to a trust company license for digital asset custody, for many reasons. Some have expressed concerns about triggering the Bank Holding Company Act (BHCA) by obtaining a Wyoming bank license, but a Wyoming special-purpose depository institution does not meet the definition of “bank” under the BHCA because it can’t make commercial loans. The US Supreme Court has rejected previous attempts by the Federal Reserve to expand this definition, so Wyoming's special-purpose depository institution is a pretty neat regulatory option for those wanting to become qualified custodians of digital assets.

* [Op Ed: Understanding the Latest FinCEN Guidance for Cryptocurrencies](https://bitcoinmagazine.com/articles/op-ed-understanding-latest-fincen-guidance-cryptocurrencies)
  > Peer-to-Peer: Services like LocalBitcoins or OTC trading, are still MSBs if the buyer or seller is advertising the services and/or making a profit from either crypto-to-crypto or fiat-to-crypto exchanges. CVC Wallets: A new four-factor test is created to determine if a wallet provider needs to register as an MSB: (a) who owns the value; (b) where the value is stored; (c) whether the owner interacts directly with the payment system where the CVC runs; and (d) whether the person acting as the intermediary has total independent control over the value.

[https://www.systems.cs.cornell.edu/docs/fincen-cvc-guidance-final.pdf](https://www.systems.cs.cornell.edu/docs/fincen-cvc-guidance-final.pdf)
  > The Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) is issuing this interpretive guidance to remind persons subject to the Bank Secrecy Act (BSA) how FinCEN regulations relating to money services businesses (MSBs) apply to certain business models1 involving money transmission denominated in value that substitutes for currency, specifically, convertible virtual currencies (CVCs).2 This guidance does not establish any new regulatory expectations or requirements. Rather, it consolidates current FinCEN regulations, and related administrative rulings and guidance issued since 2011, and then applies these rules and interpretations to other common business models involving CVC engaging in the same underlying patterns of activity.

[https://www.fincen.gov/sites/default/files/2019-05/FinCEN%20CVC%20Guidance%20FINAL.pdf](https://www.fincen.gov/sites/default/files/2019-05/FinCEN%2520CVC%2520Guidance%2520FINAL.pdf)
  > Lastly, a person who is engaged in more than one type of business model at the same time may be subject to more than one type of regulatory obligation or exemption. For example, a developer or seller of either a software application or a new CVC platform may be exempt from BSA obligations associated with creating or selling the application or CVC platform, but may still have BSA obligations as a money transmitter if the seller or developer also uses the new application to engage as a business in accepting and transmitting currency, funds, or value that substitutes for currency, or uses the new platform to engage as a business in accepting and transmitting the new CVC. Likewise, an exemption may apply to a person performing a certain role in the development or sale of a software application, while a different person using the same application to accept and transmit currency, funds, or value that substitutes for currency would be still subject to BSA obligations.
  >
  > FinCEN’s regulations define the term “money transmitter” to include a “person that provides money transmission services,” or “any other person engaged in the transfer of funds.”7 A “transmittor,” on the other hand, is “[t]he sender of the first transmittal order in a transmittal of funds. The term transmittor includes an originator, except where the transmittor’s financial institution is a financial institution or foreign financial agency other than a bank or foreign bank.”8

  > In other words, a **transmittor** *initiates* a transaction that the **money transmitter** actually *executes*.

  > Since the passage of the NSMIA, 92 percent of all private securities offerings greater than $1 million have been conducted under the more daunting Rule 506, which is exempt from blue-sky registration requirements, and not Rules 504 or 505, which remain subject to blue sky requirements. State anti-fraud provisions still apply to all offerings. This demonstrates the clear preference of securities issuers and investors for certainty and consistency in securities regulation, as they flock to SEC safe harbors that require compliance with only one uniform set of rules, and away from those that require compliance with more than 50 separate sets of rules.

The emergence of electronic cash and decentralized exchange software challengesthese expectations. Transactions need not leave any public record and exchanges can beaccomplished peer to peer without using a regulated third party in between. Faced withdiminished visibility into cryptocurrency transactions, policymakers may propose newapproaches to financial surveillance. Regulating cryptocurrency software developers andindividual users of that software under the Bank Secrecy Act would be unconstitutional underthe Fourth Amendment because it would be a warrantless search and seizure of informationprivate to cryptocurrency users. Furthermore, any law or regulation attempting to ban, requirelicensing for, or compel the altered publication (​e.g.​ backdoors) of cryptocurrency softwarewould be unconstitutional under First Amendment protections for speech.

  > If you are considering an Initial Coin Offering, sometimes referred to as an "ICO," or otherwise engaging in the offer, sale, or distribution of a digital asset,[2] you need to consider whether the U.S. federal securities laws apply. A threshold issue is whether the digital asset is a "security" under those laws.[3] The term "security" includes an "investment contract," as well as other instruments such as stocks, bonds, and transferable shares. A digital asset should be analyzed to determine whether it has the characteristics of any product that meets the definition of "security" under the federal securities laws. In this guidance, we provide a framework for analyzing whether a digital asset has the characteristics of one particular type of security – an "investment contract."[4] Both the Commission and the federal courts frequently use the "investment contract" analysis to determine whether unique or novel instruments or arrangements, such as digital assets, are securities subject to the federal securities laws.

  > Can cryptocurrencies wrest some control away from central banks and traditional financial players, and disrupt the market as we know it? The potential is certainly there! While blockchain empowered digital currencies are far from mature, their disruption of the current financial system is inevitable. Cryptocurrencies are creating a money revolution. By making some intermediary functions redundant, they call into question the paradigm of traditional fiat currencies and the role of central banks and financial institutions. However, central banks and other influential financial sector players around the globe can certainly play a major role in shaping this landscape. In response to this new paradigm, central banks and financial institutions are experimenting with, and prototyping their own cryptocurrencies

  > Keep in mind that you must raise funding from “accredited investors” for the Form D exemption to apply as noted in Rule 506 of Regulation D . These are investors who usually earn over $200,000 a year or are worth at least $1 million. You can also offer securities to companies worth at least $5 million. By either registering with the SEC or filing Form D, a business has taken the time to show they're not providing an illegal public offering.

  > While Regulation D offerings are exempt from registration with the SEC, both the SEC and the various states require filings providing notice that an offering is occurring. The SEC requires an issuer to file notice on Form D within 15 days of the date of first sale of a Reg D security on the SEC's Edgar System. Form D contains basic information about the offering and the issuer, including industry, whether a broker-dealer is involved, and the amount being raised. In addition, for each state into which the security is sold, the issuer must file a notice filing within 15 days of the first sale in that state. The majority of states use an online database to allow electronic filing. Additionally, with this notice filing, the states require the issuer to pay a filing fee, usually between $100-$500.

  > Rule 506 of Regulation D provides two distinct exemptions from registration for companies when they offer and sell securities. Companies relying on the Rule 506 exemptions can raise an unlimited amount of money. Under Rule 506(b), a “safe harbor” under Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act, a company can be assured it is within the Section 4(a)(2) exemption by satisfying certain requirements, including the following: The company cannot use general solicitation or advertising to market the securities. The company may sell its securities to an unlimited number of "accredited investors" and up to 35 other purchasers. All non-accredited investors, either alone or with a purchaser representative, must be sophisticated—that is, they must have sufficient knowledge and experience in financial and business matters to make them capable of evaluating the merits and risks of the prospective investment. Companies must decide what information to give to accredited investors, so long as it does not violate the antifraud prohibitions of the federal securities laws. This means that any information a company provides to investors must be free from false or misleading statements. Similarly, a company should not exclude any information if the omission makes what is provided to investors false or misleading. Companies must give non-accredited investors disclosure documents that are generally the same as those used in Regulation A or registered offerings, including financial statements, which in some cases may need to be certified or audited by an accountant. If a company provides information to accredited investors, it must make this information available to non-accredited investors as well. The company must be available to answer questions by prospective purchasers.

For example, a high-quality videographer usually costs about $2,000-$5,000 dollars. This is not surprising, given that another industry study has documented the importance of having a high-quality video for the success of a crowdfunding campaign.65 Also according to this market participant, bank and transaction fees also may vary depending on the type of back-end infrastructure developed by the intermediary and the type of securities offered (e.g., equity vs. debt). Some fees, such as transfer agent fees, could be on an annual basis, while others could be on a per-investor basis. One intermediary responding to the look-back survey also estimated that issuers spent approximately three to four weeks to prepare their Form C. Additionally, this intermediary stated that most issuers use cash accounting and spent thousands of dollars both to prepare financial statements that instead comply with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“U.S. GAAP”) and then to have those financial statements reviewed or audited by an independent auditor.

  > Blockstack, founded in 2013, spent ten months and $2.8 million on its Reg A+ offering. Reg A+ was adopted as part of the 2012 Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act (the “JOBS Act”), and has fewer disclosure requirements than a full-blown registration statement on Form S-1.

  > Buyers of Tokens will not have any equity ownership in Blockstack, but rather will be able to use the Tokens as currency or fuel in Blockstack’s network, a blockchain-based software platform on which developers can build “decentralized applications.” The Blockstack network has been functional since 2015 and has over 100,000 registered users and 171 live applications. The company funded the development of the Blockstack network with $5 million in venture capital financing and $47 million raised from a 2017 token offering that used Regulation D as an exemption under the U.S. securities laws.

  > Through considerable time and cost, Blockstack submitted its Regulation A+ “Tier 2” offering to the SEC for “qualification” to publicly sell its tokens (Stacks Tokens) on April 11 2019. We have reviewed all 203 dense pages of Blockstack’s Offering Circular (which is estimated to cost $1.8M in legal and accounting fees to produce) and take this opportunity to discuss the unique characteristics of the the offering which any token project will need to address in the future. While we can see that this will be the first step in standardizing token offerings under Regulation A+, we also see that there are a number of legal, business and operational issues that any token sponsor will need to address in what will inevitably be a “not as easy as advertised” process with the SEC.

  > Regulation A is available only to companies organized in and with their principal place of business in the United States or Canada. Regulation A is not available to: - companies registered or required to be registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940 and BDCs; - development stage companies that have no specific business plan or purpose or have indicated that their business plan is to engage in a merger or acquisition with an unidentified company or companies (often referred to as, “blank check companies”); - issuers of fractional undivided interests in oil or gas rights, or similar interests in other mineral rights; - issuers that are required to, but that have not, filed with the Commission the ongoing reports required by the rules under Regulation A during the two years immediately preceding the filing of a new offering statement (or for such shorter period that the issuer was required to file such reports); - issuers that are or have been subject to an order by the Commission denying, suspending, or revoking the registration of a class of securities pursuant to Section 12(j) of the Exchange Act that was entered within five years before the filing of the offering statement; and - issuers subject to “bad actor” disqualification under Rule 262. The final rules limit the types of securities eligible for sale under Regulation A to the specifically enumerated list in Section 3(b)(3) of the Securities Act, which includes warrants and convertible equity and debt securities, among other equity and debt securities. The final rules exclude asset-backed securities from the list of eligible securities.

These tokens primarily derive their value from the success of the exchanges that issue them, not from any fixed utility or the efforts of those holding the tokens. What would be the value of an exchange token if the exchange stopped running? If the website went offline and no one continued to develop the project? If there was no fee collected by the platform? The true value of exchange tokens is strongly tied to the success of the platform.

  > 
  > The first and most important step in beginning an STO is finding the right securities lawyer. With the infancy of security tokens and their intersection with crypto assets, an experienced lawyer is invaluable. Seeing as the majority of security offerings target US investors, a veteran lawyer can be the crucial difference between a successful raise and a subpoena from the SEC — ultimately killing your business dead in its tracks. Your lawyer will be responsible for regulatory filings (Reg D, Reg A+, Reg S or CF), collateral compliance and the proper disclosure of offering terms including but not limited to participation rights and warrants. Generally speaking, the filings and retainer will be the most expensive upfront costs for a security token offering.

  > Cryptocurrencies and initial coin offerings (ICO) are all the rage in startup financing. Until mid-2017, these ICOs existed in a wild west environment, a regulatory limbo, with some companies raising hundreds of millions of dollars in days and others crashing and burning in the same amount of time. Like Wyatt Earp in Dodge City, the Securities and Exchange Commission declared its jurisdiction over these ICOs, laying down the law in the “DAO Report” with the legal equivalent of a double barrel shotgun. The SEC was right to do so. There is no doubt that the overwhelming majority of ICOs involve the sale of securities and companies who ignore this conclusion do so at their own risk. Yet the law of ICOs and digital token financing is by no means final or clear, and with little official guidance to go on, startups are left to fend for themselves in a sea of self-declared experts. Few scholarly articles to date have addressed the regulatory status of these ICOs from a securities law perspective. This article provides a legal framework and method for analysis in the aggressive, case-by-case approach laid down by the SEC in the DAO Report, and recommends best practices for companies considering an ICO to follow

  > For the statutory law, I have found after many years of experience that it’s very worth it to take 8-16 hours and read the actual statutes. Such as the Securities and Exchange Act, Reg S and the recent JOBS Act changes should be required reading for startup CEOs raising money. Sure, you won’t get all the case law nor the later additions, but you’ll understand what the overall framework is. Then you can discuss specifics with a lawyer. Also if you’re a startup, some lawyers may take an advisor equity in exchange for 4 hours a month or so.
  > 
  > What led me to this conclusion is that after years and years of asking random questions while lawyers set everything up, I kept discovering new things about the exchange act until I just read it.
  > 
  > There are standard docs these days on docracy and other sites for most things. The JOBS Act has simplified fundraising quite a bit for startups.

An obscure but very useful fact is that non-equity securities do not have a limit on how many investors you can have, before you must become a publicly reporting company. And selling to NON US investors they may be able to trade your securities after 40 days. However, their local jurisdiction may have other ideas, and this is one of those areas where you can either try to abide by all local laws in theory, or in practice take advantage of the fact that, in early stages, governments of foreign jurisdictions aren’t going to waste too much political capital on long-arm actions to go after US corporations because they failed to prevent an overseas investor from selling their securities early.

The emergence of electronic cash and decentralized exchange software challengesthese expectations. Transactions need not leave any public record and exchanges can beaccomplished peer to peer without using a regulated third party in between. Faced withdiminished visibility into cryptocurrency transactions, policymakers may propose newapproaches to financial surveillance. Regulating cryptocurrency software developers andindividual users of that software under the Bank Secrecy Act would be unconstitutional underthe Fourth Amendment because it would be a warrantless search and seizure of informationprivate to cryptocurrency users. Furthermore, any law or regulation attempting to ban, requirelicensing for, or compel the altered publication (​e.g.​ backdoors) of cryptocurrency softwarewould be unconstitutional under First Amendment protections for speech.

  > Peer-to-Peer: Services like LocalBitcoins or OTC trading, are still MSBs if the buyer or seller is advertising the services and/or making a profit from either crypto-to-crypto or fiat-to-crypto exchanges. CVC Wallets: A new four-factor test is created to determine if a wallet provider needs to register as an MSB: (a) who owns the value; (b) where the value is stored; (c) whether the owner interacts directly with the payment system where the CVC runs; and (d) whether the person acting as the intermediary has total independent control over the value.

  > Trading Platforms and DEXs: “Under FinCEN regulations, a person is exempt from money transmitter status if the person only provides the delivery, communication, or network access services used by a money transmitter to support the money transmission services.” So if you only provide a forum where buyers and sellers of CVC post their bids and offers (with or without auto-matching of counterparties), and the parties match through an outside venue (individual wallet or other wallet not hosted by the trading platform), the trading platform does not qualify as a money transmitter under FinCEN. If, when the match takes place, a trading platform purchases from the seller and sells to the buyer, it’s a CVC exchanger and thus falls under the definition of money transmitter.
