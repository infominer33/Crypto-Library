Exchanges must get licensed by their local authority, must meet all local laws and industry standards, and use an account verified by Google.

If you trade in more than one country, you’ll need a certification for each country you wish to advertise in, providing its a country approved by Google.

  > An ICO issuer using Rule 506(b) cannot use “general solicitation,”[167] such as advertising, to market its tokens.[168] This prohibition on general solicitation may rule out Rule 506(b) for ICO issuers because it limits the ability to market the ICO via the Internet to a large number of potential investors. Furthermore, if non-accredited investors are participating in the offering, the ICO issuer must provide them with disclosure similar to the type of information provided in registered public offerings, an unheard-of level of disclosure for an ICO.[169] Tokens purchased pursuant to Rule 506(b) would be exempt from state registration requirements, and investors who purchase tokens in a Rule 506(b) offering would receive restricted securities, meaning they are not freely tradable unless they are either registered or comply with a valid resale exemption such as Rule 144.[170]

  > The fairly new Rule 506(c) of Regulation D complements Rule 506(b). Unlike Rule 506(b), Rule 506(c) would allow ICO issuers to use general solicitation, including advertising, to market the ICO in the U.S.[171] However, all purchasers in the offering must be accredited investors, and the ICO issuer using Rule 506(c) must take reasonable steps to verify the accredited status of the investors purchasing the tokens[172] or risk enforcement action by the SEC.[173]

  > Enacted in 2012, the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act, or JOBS Act, is intended, among other things, to reduce barriers to capital formation, particularly for smaller companies. The JOBS Act requires the SEC to adopt rules amending existing exemptions from registration under the Securities Act of 1933 and creating new exemptions that permit issuers of securities to raise capital without SEC registration. On July 10, 2013, the SEC adopted amendments to Rule 506 of Regulation D and Rule 144A under the Securities Act to implement the requirements of Section 201(a) of the JOBS Act. The amendments are effective on September 23, 2013.

Our key criteria were: - Operates clearly inside an existing regulatory framework which can manage ICOs and is interested in working with crypto organisations. - Measures taken to ensure long-term security, through strong asset and liability protections. - Provides options for secure banking operations: bank accounts not severely limited for transfer in or out, and workable for operations not just assets. - Demonstrates acceptable business conduct, with a strong reputation. - And ideally demonstrates a strong community of developers, social organisations, service providers all in service of building new economies.
