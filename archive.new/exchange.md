  > The Arwen Trading Protocol is a layer-two blockhchainprotocol that allows traders to securely trade cryptocur-rencies at a centralized exchange, without ceding cus-tody of their coins to the exchange. Before trading be-gins, traders deposit their coins in an on-blockchain es-crow, rather than in the exchange’s wallet. The agent ofescrow is the blockchain itself. Each individual trade isbacked by the coins locked in escrow. Each trade is fast,because it happens off-blockchain, and secure, becauseatomic swaps prevent even a hacked exchange from tak-ing custody of a trader’s coins. Arwen is designed towork even with the “lowest common denominator” ofblockchains—namely Bitcoin-derived coins without Seg-Wit support. As a result, Arwen supports essentiallyall “Bitcoin-derived” coins, including BTC, LTC, BCH,ZEC as well as Ethereum and ERC-20 tokens.
