Proof-of-mainstake is a sidechain proposal similar to a federated peg, with the federation membership determined by a stake of coins on the mainchain (i.e. the mainstake). As the name suggests, it is similar to proof-of-stake in that staked coins are used to indicate a controlling interest.

Proof-of-Work and Proof-of-Stake are **sybil control mechanisms**. PoS doesn't achieve consensus by itself. It has to be coupled with a protocol, such as PBFT, or Ben-Or, or Tendermint/Cosmos, or Avalanche, to make decisions.
