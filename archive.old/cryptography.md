Our design of both components improves in functionality and efficiency over prior work, as follows.

The best place to start, for an understanding of mathematical cryptography, is probably Part 5 (replacing all references to “algebraic group G” by F ∗ p ). For an introduction to RSA and Rabin one could start reading at Part 6 and ignore most references to the earlier parts.

  > Abstract. The area of practical computational integrity proof systems, like SNARKs, STARKs, Bulletproofs, is seeing a very dynamic development with several constructions appeared in 2019 with improved properties and relaxed setup requirements. Many use cases of such systems involve, often as their most expensive apart, proving the knowledge of a preimage under a certain cryptographic hash function, which is expressed as a circuit over a large prime (sometimes binary) field. A zero-knowledge proof of coin ownership in the Zcash cryptocurrency is a notable example, where the inadequacy of SHA-256 hash function for such a circuit caused a huge computational penalty

  > A variety of "key recovery," "key escrow," and "trusted third-party" encryption requirements have been suggested in recent years by government agencies seeking to conduct covert surveillance within the changing environments brought about by new technologies. This report examines the fundamental properties of these requirements and attempts to outline the technical risks, costs, and implications of deploying systems that provide government access to encryption keys.
