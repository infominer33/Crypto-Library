A hackathon without a party ain't nothing. So we got two. First join us for a decentralized pub crawl (and a DAI happy hour) and then @fabric_vc, @DharmaProtocol, Cambrial, @ParityTech and of course @SpankChain will meet you at Chalet Berlin - Register at the hackathon!




It's a shame these require to be in-person
