"Komodo Platform uses a unique security mechanism to protect the KMD chain. In essence, it leverages the hashrate of the Bitcoin network to protect Komodo. This is made possible by storing backups of the KMD blockchain onto the Bitcoin ledger. Hereâ€™s how it works. Every ten minutes, a block hash from a block in the KMD chain is written into a block on the Bitcoin blockchain. This process is called notarization and it is the backbone of Komodoâ€™s security mechanism. Komodo Platformâ€™s notary nodes carry out the technical work required to successfully complete notarizations."

[Security: Delayed Proof of Work (dPoW) - Komodo](https://komodoplatform.com/security-delayed-proof-of-work-dpow/)

Komodo Platform is the world leader in blockchain solutions. This post discusses Delayed Proof of Work (dPoW), Komodo's innovative security mechanism.

As we look to the second half of 2018, Komodo is prepared to offer delayed Proof of Work (dPoW) security to any projects that would like to improve their security. This service is available to any UTXO-based blockchains. In fact, Komodo's Blockchain Security Service is already demonstrating its functionality and efficacy. We are proud to announce that we are already providing this invaluable service to six different blockchains: GAME Credits, Kreds, Einsteinium, HUSH, SUQA, and GIN Coin. Several more projects have signed up to receive Komodoâ€™s Blockchain Security Service and are working through the integration process now.
