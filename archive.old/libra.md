"Honestly, I don‚Äôt view this as a literal plagiarism. But I do think that they have recognized that this council that we created was a good idea. Although theirs may have some slight differences, I think when we started this, people were saying, ‚Äò *that‚Äôs crazy, you can‚Äôt have a council*.‚Äô And now I think people are going to realize, no, *you really need one*. You need to trust not just a handful of developers to run this thing.

Sidewalk Labs is... not my favorite google project. Canadian academics and privacy rights activists have been yelling at them for 5 years to drive across town and talk to Tim Bouma or any number of Toronto-based or Ottawa-based DID people, and they've been answering hundreds of very valid criticisms with corporate doublespeak and "we'll look into it" this whole time. For the record, Bouma is a saint among men and very "reachable"-- I wager he would probably do an interview or a phone meeting with just about anyone working seriously in the DID world, which is not something I can say about most important people in this sector.

The NYT (which I predict will stay very much in the anti-Libra camp) ran this gossipy piece about how conditional all the sign-ons to the association are. This jives with all my recent research into blockchain consortia and "neo-extranets": people sign letters of interest, letters of commitment with conditions, agreements with multiple escape hatches, etc. for these kinds of partnerships, there's a LOT of fine print [https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/25/technology/facebook-libra-cryptocurrency.html?utm_campaign=The%20Interface&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/25/technology/facebook-libra-cryptocurrency.html?utm_campaign=The%2520Interface&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%2520newsletter)

Alphaville: "Marcus asked the question himself but doesn't seem to have really answered it:

*is this really a blockchain?*

We've argued the fact that the Libra Blockchain doesn't feature a chain of blocks ‚Äî which you'd think would be important ‚Äî but is rather a ‚Äúsingle data structure‚Äù means it's not a blockchain. But it seems Marcus has a different idea of what blockchain means. If his definition is that it is ‚Äúopen‚Äù and ‚Äúdecentralised‚Äù, as he in some ways implies in the question, then he does kind of answer it, but as you can see above, the answer would be... no? Unless, if we really want to give him the benefit of the doubt, Marcus's definition of blockchain is that it is quite decentralised and quite open. (Although even then, the idea that 100 ‚Äúindustry-diverse organisations‚Äù running nodes is ‚Äúquite decentralised‚Äù is all very well and good, but there have been only 28 organisations announced so far, including Facebook.) If that's his definition, however, then the world of blockchain suddenly gets a lot bigger. Isn't Uber quite decentralised and quite open? Is Uber a blockchain? Isn't a bank whose API can be plugged into also quite decentralised and its ownership structure also quite decentralised because anyone can buy its stock? Is a bank a blockchain?"
