Just going to give you a rundown of how it can be applied, and then you can go off and use some of the following links There are a couple of different ways blockchain can be applied to life sciences. In a research capacity, definitely with data storage more safely. (Link 1) In the field of scientific publishing, many scientists are very conscious of their IP being stolen, and subsequently they only publish successful data as they don't want others to potentially try and pass off any other data as being their own. Blockchain would obviously 'solve' this as your data would be TSd and verified. A blockchain system could allow scientists to safely secure their data from the original conception, and would prevent anyone from stealing it. The main benefit this provides is that scientists can then publish more data related to a project. Unsuccessful data, which currently is not being published, could give insight to other scientists in regard to what does not work etc. (Link 2) Many pharma companies, which generate billions of R&D data points daily, rely on the safety and integrity of such storage. Blockchain offers a tremendous solution for this, as the data itself would be stored more safely but also would make sure that nobody can fabricate data retrospectively or even steal it. Pharma companies also rely on their own supply chain, and that is a huge aspect of drug safety and having R&D of high quality and integrity. Blockchain would provide a solution for that Link 1 - [https://publishingperspectives.com/2017/11/digital-science-scholarly-publishing-blockchain-report/](https://publishingperspectives.com/2017/11/digital-science-scholarly-publishing-blockchain-report/) Link 2 - [https://www.thepharmaletter.com/article/how-will-blockchain-impact-on-pharma](https://www.thepharmaletter.com/article/how-will-blockchain-impact-on-pharma)

'It would make larger parts of the research cycle open to self-correction,' says the Digital Science report's author, but so might 'a less drastic change.'

[How will blockchain impact pharma?](https://www.thepharmaletter.com/article/how-will-blockchain-impact-on-pharma)

At first glance, the global pharmaceutical industry, often regarded as slow-moving, conservative and resistant to change, appears infertile ground for an innova

(Link 3) Hospitals rely on their supply chains being really strict, especially with drug supply. Blockchain would allow for hospitals to have greater confidence in the drug supply. (Link 4) Basic data storage of patient data in hospitals is currently extremely fragmented, and issues raised concerning safety (e.g. Singapore case, 1.5m patients data stolen due to shortcoming of being centralised) Link 3 - [https://www.redchalk.com/feature/rubix-by-deloitte-on-blockchain-use-cases-for-the-pharmaceutical-supply-chain/](https://www.redchalk.com/feature/rubix-by-deloitte-on-blockchain-use-cases-for-the-pharmaceutical-supply-chain/) Link 4 - [https://www.ft.com/content/6f138722-47d4-11e8-8c77-ff51caedcde6](https://www.ft.com/content/6f138722-47d4-11e8-8c77-ff51caedcde6)

Basically what I try to do is get root sources for everything, or as close to root as possible.. I may have to get creative in channel creation, and idk... Organization isn't always easy hehe.. I'll look over this stuff later today.. Mostly I have to focus on an article about blockchain for identity management

Due before I go to bed, and it's only halfway finished



Yeah I get that

Dw, sorry if I'm throwing things off pace a little as a newbie haha

Maybe root sources belong in here, and a channel for column/popular articles?



hmm... that's a good idea...

submissions channel is for everything and anything though... that and #deleted-channel

then we can sort it all out later



Awesome

even though there's no actual research done yet, I put that in #🗃-literature



Yep, cool.



I love it!

library: being built



I've actually got an interview w Frontiers on Friday lol, if I secure it I can guarantee you we'll be getting a load of first-hand research in here haha



what's frontiers?



Huge Scientific publisher, that's what the last link was for



ooooh, cool!~

actual research is hard work



Yeah I can't imagine how hard it must be in this field lol



I like this version better, where I just read articles



It's still so discovery

Haha



there's actually a ton of research on cryptography and distributed systems...



Yeah



plenty of previous academic work done even on blockchain to build upon



I'm still shocked at how old blockchain is lol



I assume you've browsed this: [https://github.com/bellaj/Blockchain](https://github.com/bellaj/Blockchain)

[bellaj/Blockchain](https://github.com/bellaj/Blockchain)

Compilation of useful documents and scientific papers about Blockchain & cryptocurrencies.

Yep! Actually today haha



there's another repository similar to that I have to find again



guys, guys guys guys your book section is woefully under stocked



sorry, I just started building the library a week ago :p

that's why I invited you to come help

I haven't quite moved all of my various resources into channels here, yet... but getting there

you can drop any submissions to the library right in this channel @EpistemiCrisis much appreciated

ok, now I'm done



damn bro..

that's a lotta books on trading



I may have gone a little overboard collecting resources when I first joined crypto



oh haha... maybe not if you only have books on trading :p

thanks for sharing, for sure!

I have a telegram that is a collection of books on trading, but the google drives are a lot more convenient



yeah, sorry, I'm more of a trader than a techie, but I believe in the technology and I've been an early adopter for a long time

I actually did some bitcoin mining in 2011



no need to be sorry

oh cool



but I admit I didn't really see the potential -_-x



hard to imagine back in the day getting this big

even still, I think there's a lotta room for growth... 10 years from now .... imagine

@vincent I'm digging your links. what do you get into?



hmm?



I mean... what's your primary focus around crypto?



still not sure what you mean lol, am a bit tired

im a trader

but dabble in the technical stuff



gotcha, you love mainly bitcoin, ethereum... or?



i dont really have any favorites, mostly focus on "lowcaps" and smaller projects now



right on

you do alright with that?



oh yeah lol



I plan to learn trading, eventually... after I master the fundamentals

but... I've been studying charts and trading strategies for a while

I don't have enough that I wanna risk to learn-by-trading, yet

researching and writing freelance blockchain crypto, whatever

ai



you have a twitter or medium or something?



@cryptinfominer on twitter

haven't started a medium, yet... but I made an account yesterday

gotta build my portfolio page, first

I wanna start the medium by doing a deep history of bitcoin. beginning with the history of cryptography then a history of the cryptography used in bitcoin, then about cypherpunks, then the beginning of virtual currency, then bitcoin with a post detailing its history for each year since its been around, eventually expanding to all of the topics



sounds pretty ambitious lol



yeah, well, it's necessary

if something like that already existed somewhere, to my standards of research, then I would do something else

and ya know... I plan to make more than the 3rd world wages I'm currently pulling, eventually

some are a bit shady, and it's copyright breach of course - maybe we don't post it



shady?



Scammy



what are you talkin gabout?

it's just a bunch of TA books?



Well yeah some are also videos and some are weird like infinite profitability



oh

well, it's already in the library... I wouldn't worry about it too much


Ah ok

Anyway I found some very nice videos like trade dante old stuff



after a while I'll do an audit of the library, I know there are duplicate entries, and multiple entries with duplicate content...

it's starting to get pretty vast already, the idea of an audit is intimidating



Ahah yeah should be automated at some point



I go through entire channels rather frequently.. depending on whatever I need to know about..

I could write for years based on this material alone

but, writing on a subject means first I scour the library, then theres always additional research, new resources... it's a fun obsession



We could ask to the owner of crypto research network

He finds scammers in discord

If he can help with some automation in here

He’s a cool guy who’s making hard work to create a better and safer place in here with his bots



crypto research network?



iBerry420 is the guy, yeah look for the discord channel



actually, I expect these archives to be mined by a number of different people\organizations

I searched, can you send me an invite?



Yeah just woke up

Ok need to check that out

My dream is to print all of this knowledge and settle in an isolated tree house in the amazonian forest and read all of that.

For one year, no more. (Cutting on all distractions )



Hehe

I jusy organize so i know where to find info when i need it

I dont read all the stuff here, but keep track of valuable info



Yep Maybe this will be the first example of what we call a “digital library”

Well played for the meta tags

they work perfectly



that og:image is my fav

I should contact the artist because im getting bigger... better to share w them



tippin.me looks nice

Have you received any tips through their services?



Nah, i havent tried tho

Been too busy studying crypto to learn all those things and promote

But the site is growing fast

Better to build build build then when i have too much traffic i can figure the rest

Google likes my stuff


Sure it is All I can say is keep going Yes exactly like startups get big asap even if you’re in the red and hope one day you explode (in a good way)


I got nothing but runway

[Mike Olthoff ⚡🐶💩👑 (@olthoff)](https://twitter.com/olthoff/status/1141081271621341186?s=12)

Are there tools for accessibility for using Bitcoin? Tools for the blind etc? I can't imagine BTC addresses being very easy to verify on say a Ledger or Trezor if you can't read the screen.




So big fan of EthHub ([https://discord.gg/SZUcGBV](https://discord.gg/SZUcGBV) ) and the Ethereum community. When it comes to posting resources for major crypto protocols like Ethereum.. does it make sense to create its own category or “info-mine” for the authoritative source Discord server?? If there is one? Of course, Ethereum has their own great website resources too... so @⧉infominer what/where would you suggest?



yes of course, you can drop links directly in teh channels you best think fit, int his case #🗃-communities @DLT Rico
