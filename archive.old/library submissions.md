Just going to give you a rundown of how it can be applied, and then you can go off and use some of the following links There are a couple of different ways blockchain can be applied to life sciences. In a research capacity, definitely with data storage more safely. (Link 1) In the field of scientific publishing, many scientists are very conscious of their IP being stolen, and subsequently they only publish successful data as they don't want others to potentially try and pass off any other data as being their own. Blockchain would obviously 'solve' this as your data would be TSd and verified. A blockchain system could allow scientists to safely secure their data from the original conception, and would prevent anyone from stealing it. The main benefit this provides is that scientists can then publish more data related to a project. Unsuccessful data, which currently is not being published, could give insight to other scientists in regard to what does not work etc. (Link 2) Many pharma companies, which generate billions of R&D data points daily, rely on the safety and integrity of such storage. Blockchain offers a tremendous solution for this, as the data itself would be stored more safely but also would make sure that nobody can fabricate data retrospectively or even steal it. Pharma companies also rely on their own supply chain, and that is a huge aspect of drug safety and having R&D of high quality and integrity. Blockchain would provide a solution for that Link 1 - [https://publishingperspectives.com/2017/11/digital-science-scholarly-publishing-blockchain-report/](https://publishingperspectives.com/2017/11/digital-science-scholarly-publishing-blockchain-report/) Link 2 - [https://www.thepharmaletter.com/article/how-will-blockchain-impact-on-pharma](https://www.thepharmaletter.com/article/how-will-blockchain-impact-on-pharma)

'It would make larger parts of the research cycle open to self-correction,' says the Digital Science report's author, but so might 'a less drastic change.'

[How will blockchain impact pharma?](https://www.thepharmaletter.com/article/how-will-blockchain-impact-on-pharma)

At first glance, the global pharmaceutical industry, often regarded as slow-moving, conservative and resistant to change, appears infertile ground for an innova

(Link 3) Hospitals rely on their supply chains being really strict, especially with drug supply. Blockchain would allow for hospitals to have greater confidence in the drug supply. (Link 4) Basic data storage of patient data in hospitals is currently extremely fragmented, and issues raised concerning safety (e.g. Singapore case, 1.5m patients data stolen due to shortcoming of being centralised) Link 3 - [https://www.redchalk.com/feature/rubix-by-deloitte-on-blockchain-use-cases-for-the-pharmaceutical-supply-chain/](https://www.redchalk.com/feature/rubix-by-deloitte-on-blockchain-use-cases-for-the-pharmaceutical-supply-chain/) Link 4 - [https://www.ft.com/content/6f138722-47d4-11e8-8c77-ff51caedcde6](https://www.ft.com/content/6f138722-47d4-11e8-8c77-ff51caedcde6)

Basically what I try to do is get root sources for everything, or as close to root as possible.. I may have to get creative in channel creation, and idk... Organization isn't always easy hehe.. I'll look over this stuff later today.. Mostly I have to focus on an article about blockchain for identity management

So big fan of EthHub ([https://discord.gg/SZUcGBV](https://discord.gg/SZUcGBV) ) and the Ethereum community. When it comes to posting resources for major crypto protocols like Ethereum.. does it make sense to create its own category or “info-mine” for the authoritative source Discord server?? If there is one? Of course, Ethereum has their own great website resources too... so @⧉infominer what/where would you suggest?
