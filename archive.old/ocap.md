Abstract.Contracts enable mutually suspicious parties to cooperate safelythrough the exchange of rights. Smart contracts are programs whose behaviorenforces the terms of the contract. This paper shows how such contracts can bespecified elegantly and executed safely, given an appropriate distributed, secure,persistent, and ubiquitous computational fabric. JavaScript provides the ubiquitybut must be significantly extended to deal with the other aspects. The first partof this paper is a progress report on our efforts to turn JavaScript into this fabric.To demonstrate the suitability of this design, we describe an escrow exchangecontract implemented in 42 lines of JavaScript code.

Linked Data Signatures enable a method of asserting the integrity of linked data documents that are passed throughout the web. The object capability model is a powerful system for ensuring the security of computing systems. In this paper, we explore layering an object capability model on top of Linked Data Signatures via chains of signed proclamations. fn:1 We call this system "Linked Data Capabilities", or "ld-ocap" for short.

Veres One's architecture has been adjusted to take full advantage of Linked Data Capabilities as its primary mechanism for granting authority to perform operations on the ledger as well as on DID Documents. permission to update key materials can be conditionally handed out to an entity (or entities) and later revoked if deemed appropriate using Linked Data Capabilities' design.

>

As for ledger updates, Accelerators also make use of Linked Data Capabilities. To prevent spamming the ledger, the costs of an update must somehow be accounted for. The traditional way to do this on a blockchain is to use proof of work, and this is also an option in Veres One, but for those use cases where expending time and energy on proof of work is less desirable users can use an "accelerator".

>

An accelerator is an entity that has been granted a capability to perform updates on the ledger more quickly. Accelerators may likewise take advantage of Linked Data Capabilities' support for delegation, with or without caveats.
