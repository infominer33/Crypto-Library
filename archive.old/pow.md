[The Anatomy of Proof-of-Work ‚Äì Bitcoin Tech Talk](https://bitcointechtalk.com/the-anatomy-of-proof-of-work-98c85b6f6667)

Proof-of-Work (PoW) was originally invented as a measure against email spams. Only later it was adapted to be used in digital cash [1].

1/ Most people think #Bitcoin‚Äôs PoW is "wasteful." I explore how everything is energy, money is energy, subjective use of energy, and PoW's costs relative to existing governance systems For a deeper dive, my Medium post: [https://t.co/a3wJW5Y1Ni](https://t.co/a3wJW5Y1Ni) TL;DR - check out this t...

1/ Most people have misconceptions about PoW being "wasteful." Because this narrative is so popular, I've spent some time collecting my thoughts on its utility, efficiency, and morality. A thread: [https://t.co/H8FsrqZFZ7](https://t.co/H8FsrqZFZ7)
