I figured out public key cryptography, using either GPG, Keybase, or both in concert... aaand my protonmail address is linked up w the same public key, and my github. I did it because I write about it all the time and was sick of being GPGs bitch... it's just a piece of software with a few commands.. nbd To celebrate, I want to invite @everyone and\or anyone who wants to use PGP (mostly because governments don't want you to... and to keep all the spammers from spying on your e-mail, or whatever you're into) but tried and gave up because it's complicated (to figure out the first time), or never even tried because everyone says its hard. Check out this resource I created with a bunch of helpful links, and feel free to DM or message here if you're interested... or wanna swap public keys

or whatev

what is infominer.id?



that's my website

and a few other sites branching out from it

just a beginning


pilotdave 03-Apr-19 07:46 PM

ah gotcha i thought maybe this was ona chain



Ooh, nothing like that yet... still learning some fundamentals of publishing via github

But i have seen a number of interesting ways to introduce crypto

And im sure there are plenty that i havent heard of yet



really... Protonmail is easy, cause its built in encryption, with the option of adding your public key and sending a copy of it with each message

so right there, you are sticking your finger to the data collectors.. and of course still use some of their free services... fuck. there are alternatives.. but everyone wants to use google docs, because its good.

.. anyways, 1 step at a time, amirite? ..

keybase is cool... another social networking tool... for crypto(graphy).. but also has encrypted storage.. so you can open a repository there and make teams.. so pretty cool for devs who want to work in private

or whatever, storage..

and a way to share a key between devices

idk.. i'm just learning about all this stuff, so I guess I will babble more and then reshare the original message

so yeah, you can also use keybase as a standalone app, without needing to master GPG immediately...

a little commandline, but keybase can handle some of the more tedious stuff automagically

I haven't reached out to anyone that I didn't meet another way, but i suppose I could just pick whoever is on the app and send them a message... and probably liklier to respond than a cold call e-mail.



This is very useful. Thanks for the post.

Did your last Yubikey just break? Perhaps you forgot an offline backup password.
