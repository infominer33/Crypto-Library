"Passionate about coding and the inner workings of a technology he himself invented, he doesn't care that this technology serves no practical purpose. Like all programmers, he likes to write code for the sake of it, and talk about the code he wrote." [https://t.co/TTycTy3rmH](https://t.co/TTycTy3rmH)
