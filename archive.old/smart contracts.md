* [A Formal Language for Analyzing Contracts](https://nakamotoinstitute.org/contract-language/)
  > The author presents a mini-language for professionals and researchers interested in drafting and analyzing contracts. It is intended for computers to read, too. The main purpose of this language is to specify, as unambiguously and completely and succinctly as possible, common contracts or contractual terms. These include financial contracts, liens and other kinds of security, transfer of ownership, performance of online services, and supply chain workflow.

  > * Dana (2009) - a detailed post on contract languages, virtual economies in Second Life, and the PLT aspects.

  > * Easylanguage: domain specific language for trading stocks (2007)
  > * Combinators for contracts (2006), which links to SPJ's Composing Contracts (2000), a great paper.
  > * And of course, nearly all of the above threads mention Nick Szabo's original smart contract language (2002), posted on LtU here but with no discussion, and his Secure Property Titles with Owner Authority (1998)

* [Simplicity: A New Language for Blockchains](https://blockstream.com/simplicity.pdf)
  > Simplicity is a typed, combinator-based, functional language without loops and recursion, designed to be used for crypto-currencies and blockchain applications. It aims to improve upon existing crypto-currency languages, such as Bitcoin Script and Ethereum’s EVM, while avoiding some of the problems they face. Simplicity comes with formal denotational semantics defined in Coq, a popular, general purpose software proof assistant. Simplicity also includes operational semantics that are defined with an abstract machine that we call the Bit Machine. The Bit Machine is used as a tool for measuring the computational space and time resources needed to evaluate Simplicity programs. Owing to its Turing incompleteness, Simplicity is amenable to static analysis that can be used to derive upper bounds on the computational resources needed, prior to execution. While Turing incomplete, Simplicity can express any finitary function, which we believe is enough to build useful “smart contracts” for blockchain applications.

* [Safer smart contracts through type-driven development](https://publications.lib.chalmers.se/records/fulltext/234939/234939.pdf) Using dependent and polymorphic types for safer development of smart contracts
  > We show how dependent and polymorphic types can make smart contract development safer. This is demonstrated by using the functional language Idris to describe smart contracts on the Ethereum platform. In particular, we show how one class of common errors can be captured at compile time using dependent types and algebraic side effects. We also bring type annotations to the realm of smart contracts, helping developers to circumvent another class of common errors. To demonstrate the feasibility of our solutions, we have extended the Idris compiler with a backend for the Ethereum Virtual Machine. While we find that the functional paradigm might not be the most suitable for the domain, our approach solves the identified problems and provides advantages over the languages in current use.

Yet there are still major barriers to doing business internationally. The cost of doing business globally is increasingly dominated by issues of jurisdiction, security, and trust: the costs of developing, maintaining, and securing our relationships.
