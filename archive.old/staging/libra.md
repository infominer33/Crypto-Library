  > On Tuesday (June 18), Facebook announced that it is creating a new "low-volatility" cryptocurrency (a fully fiat-collateralized stablecoin) called Libra (LBR), built-on top of a permissioned but public blockchain called Libra Blockchain. It also said that one of its subsidiaries (called Calibra) is building a wallet (called Calibra) that will let you "save, send and spend Libra". This article aims to answer all the questions that you may have about Libra and Calibra.

Rather, Libra is a Swiss-based organization, and Facebook is just one of (eventually) 100 members. Voting in Libra is stake-based, so that doesn't necessarily mean Facebook will just have 1% of the voting power. They could have much more depending on their stake.

For people who don't know, ChanZuckerberg is the "research hospital"/clinic housed by "Zuckerberg SF General" , which was the result of Zuck "charitably" buying out a debt-crippled public general hospital in a city without enough hospitals (or, more generally speaking, infrastructure).

"Honestly, I don’t view this as a literal plagiarism. But I do think that they have recognized that this council that we created was a good idea. Although theirs may have some slight differences, I think when we started this, people were saying, ‘ *that’s crazy, you can’t have a council*.’ And now I think people are going to realize, no, *you really need one*. You need to trust not just a handful of developers to run this thing. You need to have huge companies that compete with each other, that are able to balance each other, spread around the world, that’s what you really need to have trust in something."

I’ve spent my academic career trying (in my limited way) to undo the privacy damage computers have done to our society, but what’s the point when Facebook wants to make a few bucks. This makes me ill.


Alphaville: "Marcus asked the question himself but doesn't seem to have really answered it:

*is this really a blockchain?*

We've argued the fact that the Libra Blockchain doesn't feature a chain of blocks — which you'd think would be important — but is rather a “single data structure” means it's not a blockchain. But it seems Marcus has a different idea of what blockchain means. If his definition is that it is “open” and “decentralised”, as he in some ways implies in the question, then he does kind of answer it, but as you can see above, the answer would be... no? Unless, if we really want to give him the benefit of the doubt, Marcus's definition of blockchain is that it is quite decentralised and quite open. (Although even then, the idea that 100 “industry-diverse organisations” running nodes is “quite decentralised” is all very well and good, but there have been only 28 organisations announced so far, including Facebook.) If that's his definition, however, then the world of blockchain suddenly gets a lot bigger. Isn't Uber quite decentralised and quite open? Is Uber a blockchain? Isn't a bank whose API can be plugged into also quite decentralised and its ownership structure also quite decentralised because anyone can buy its stock? Is a bank a blockchain?"
