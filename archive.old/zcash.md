This doesn't get mentioned often, but #zcash is in a super weird position. They cannot afford for ppl to actually use zcash to protect their privacy from govt right now. It's for their safety, their investors $, and to allow them to continue working on zcash. [https://t.co/](https://t.co/)...

There's been some claims made recently that a compromise of the Zcash trusted setup can't compromise privacy. I checked with one of the cryptographers working on zk-SNARKs, and these claims are false. A compromised MPC absolutely can wreck privacy; Zooko needs to correct...

[What are zk-SNARKs? | Zcash](https://z.cash/technology/zksnarks)

zk-SNARKs are a novel form of zero-knowledge cryptography which allow for private Zcash transactions. These transactions can be fully encrypted on the blockchain, yet still be verified by zK-SNARKs as valid under the network‚Äôs consensus rules.

I do have issues with the original zcash ceremony Namely because a whole 6 people participated which seems (sarcasm heavily implied) super safe and secure But there's a reason there was a another (public) ceremony with an actual decentralized participation that had a hell of a lot more participants And that's why there was a very strong push from the zcash devs to switch the protocol to using the parameters from that ceremony Here's the paper for the powers of tau ceremony (the second one that was public)

It's a widespread mistake to think that the Zcash Founders Reward or a possible future Dev Fund results in higher sell pressure on the coin compared to sending 100% of the coins to miners. Here's my post on reddit about this in response to a comment: [https://t.co/UbGSocfl0s](https://t.co/UbGSocfl0s)

@sonyasupposedly @nic__carter 1/ It‚Äôs a sticky situation. On the surface level, one would say that ‚Äúdev fund bad‚Äù, while on the other hand I see no way for ZEC to stay above water in current state without the high-pay team currently helping to maintain it. But it‚Äô...
