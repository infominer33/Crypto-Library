Summary\nCrypto-assets,1 such as bitcoin2 and ether, reached an estimated total market capitalisation of $830 billion on 8 January 2018, before falling sharply in subsequent months. These markets remain small compared to the global financial system, and crypto-assets are not yet widely used for financial transactions, but markets are changing rapidly. The growth of crypto-asset trading platforms (often misleadingly called ‘exchanges’);3 the introduction of new financial products (such as crypto-asset funds and trusts and exchange-traded products); and the growing interest by retail investors, raise questions about the implications of crypto-assets for financial
