This page has two toml files from [sourcecrypto/sourcecrypto.github.io](https://github.com/sourcecrypto/sourcecrypto.github.io) embedded into it, with some help from [gist-it.appspot.com](https://gist-it.appspot.com)

Note: Clearly that embed is not working, or at least not for me... maybe my ublock extension is working too hard.

## Wish List

* some simple way to check [Decentralized-id.com](https://decentralized-id.com/) (or any website) against a csv of links, to see which are nto included.

* an app that will take a list of links as the input and output a toml file with title\description automatically populated based on metadata..

* an app that will patrol discord servers looking for broken links and creating a pull-request with a fix (if available), and submitting to archive.org \ archive.is for saving.

that would make life a lot easier.. 

I suppose it would make the most sense to prioritize those objectives, rather than constructing everything by hand.

Scraping a list of links from wherever I want is simple.. so really the two things are checking a list of links against a toml file(s), outputting any links not found in the db already. Another script to construct a toml file grabbing metadata.

@MaciekLaskus suggested I include authors, which is true. I believe I intended to eventually:
  >what's really missing is tagging all of these resources by authors, co-authors, references/citations
  >
  > once this is done, topical tags can be derived algorithmically<br>
