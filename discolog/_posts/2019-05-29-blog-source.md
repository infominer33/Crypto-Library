It's safe to say that I'm testing the limits of the Minimal Mistakes theme, here.

I decided to try out the blog format, mostly just to see if it would work.

A neat thing w blogs, is by using tags and categories there are many different ways to display and interact with the content.

I found out that using too many collections will break this theme. 

Collections are a simple way to throw a bunch of similar type of documents in a directory and display them together, without a bunch of manual labor.

I expanded to 12 categories, and it broke.

Then, I dropped back to 9 and nav came back.

So I wanted to see if I started a blog would the site still work.

9 categories and a blog are ok... 

That's a lot of ways to organize information :)

I doubt I'll stick with the post index home page for long, since I don't expect to be blogging here, much.

However, it's good to know I can, and this is where any long serious crypto articles I write would live.
