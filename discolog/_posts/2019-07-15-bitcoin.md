This page, at the moment, is mainly the contents of the [Bitcoin Channel](https://sourcecrypto.pub/discolog/crypto/bitcoin/) from SourceCrypto Discord server.

This is my first attempt at organizing information related specifically to Bitcoin. We also have [Bitcoin Dev](https://sourcecrypto.pub/discolog/development/bitcoin-dev/) and [BTC-Layer2](https://sourcecrypto.pub/discolog/crypto/btc-layer2/) channels that must be sorted.

To be honest, much of the contents of the source crypto Discord Server are bitcoin related, but organized into channels by topic. Where there might be articles about other cryptosystems and bitcoin together on that particular subject. For now, I'm working on filling out this page, weeding out some stale links, organizing, and also working on separate pages for practical Bitcoin. Later, I can comb through the SourceCrypto Discord server... but mostly I'll just grow this content in it's new home and SourceCrypto will grow its own direction.

**I have created a new Discord Server for organizing information related to Bitcoin called:**

## [BTC-Nerds](https://discord.gg/GAVs9Kd)

So, I'm gradually combing through SourceCrypto and moving all Bitcoin content to it's own home with no distractions, that will have its own web-site soon too.

**Bitcoin Information & Resources**
  >Bitcoin is a revolutionary system that is quite complex and has a steep learning curve. Below you'll find curated educational resources and information about Bitcoin. You could spend months sifting through them all. Make sure you have a decent grasp of the system before you store a significant amount of value in it! The same aspects of Bitcoin that make it so valuable also make it unforgiving to those who make mistakes.

  >In this talk Pieter went into the benefits of these ideas and discussed an upcoming proposal for a first step that combines a subset of these ideas. Some ideas will be left for future extensions, in order to avoid complexity and limiting the design space. Yet, this would bring privacy and flexibility benefits to Bitcoin, as well as moderate scaling advantages. The main focus is Taproot, which has the potential to make all outputs look identical, by merging pay-to-pubkey and pay-to-scripthash into one - but other changes will be needed to make it widely applicable and efficient."

  >Over the past year, the prevailing thought among many in the cryptocurrency communities is that bitcoin is not keeping up with other coins. That somehow bitcoin was being intentionally crippled, or that the developers did not know what they were doing. As we are seeing with the bitcoin dominance going up, that prevailing thought was wrong. The coins who were supposedly going to kill bitcoin have been all but abandoned in many cases. Many others are in the process of dying a slow death (which may take years to fully play out).

 > The UTXO set is a growing problem. We had a talk this morning about dust in the UTXO talk. We have about 60 million UTXOs. The problem is that as we heard in the talk before, the blockchain is quite an inefficient data structure for UTXOs because if I want to download an old block, I need all the blockheaders in between. If I want to download an old transaction and check if it's unspent and I only have the head of the blockchain, then I need to check all the inbetween transactions and check if they spend my transaction or not.

If Bitcoin’s governance is flawed, Bitcoin’s stakeholders should work to fix it.
