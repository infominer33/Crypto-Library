## Wallets

>**Wallet Basics:**
>  * Do not use wallets that don't give you recovery data; these wallets are likely controlling your keys.
>  * Do not use paper wallets unless you're an advanced user who understands all the risks.
>  * Do not store large amounts of value in single signature wallets.
>  * Make sure your heirs know how to recover your wallets without you!

* [lopp.net - Recommended Wallets](https://www.lopp.net/bitcoin-information/recommended-wallets.html)
  >There are dozens of wallets to choose from when it comes to securing your private keys. Hardware, software, metal, paper, each with their own trade-offs. Remember: if you aren't holding your own private keys, you don't actually own bitcoin - you just own an IOU for BTC!

*Note that it is NOT recommended that novices use the Bitcoin Core wallet. If you want to use a wallet backed by a fully validating node you run, read Securing Your Financial Sovereignty.*

  >**Take time to educate yourself** - Bitcoin is different from what you know and use every day. Before you start using Bitcoin for any serious transaction, be sure to read what you need to know and take appropriate steps to secure your wallet. Always remember that it is your responsibility to choose your wallet carefully and adopt good practices in order to protect your money.
