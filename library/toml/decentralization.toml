[How to Disincentivize Large Bitcoin Mining Pools]
Link = ["http://hackingdistributed.com/2014/06/18/how-to-disincentivize-large-bitcoin-mining-pools/"]
Description = "Recently, the GHash mining pool breached Bitcoin etiquette to become a 55% miner for Bitcoin [*]. This collapsed the key value proposition of Bitcoin, namely, its decentralization. In turn, there has been considerable criticism and backlash. Many people in the community, including us, have noted that etiquette or the good will of miners are not sufficient to keep monopolies at bay, and called for technical measures to disincentivize large mining pools."

Descriptoin = "2016 was all about performance and scalability, 2017 was all about security. These are technical challenges. The harder challenges are the social and political ones. One of the key unsolved challenges is the de-centralised business model. I have consistently messaged that ‘there is no point replacing one centralised business model with another’. I believe 2018 will be the year that many in the blockchain domain wake up to the fact that there is little point distributing the technology if you are not going to distribute the business model. This challenge remains within all the blockchain projects I am focused on."

Link = ["https://www.tokendaily.co/blog/the-death-of-decentralization"]
Description = "It's no secret that 'decentralization' has been reduced to a marketing buzzword, and it's losing meaning through its misuse. Your project or idea may have some qualities that decentralization facilitates (censorship resistance, immutability, accessibility, etc) — but it is not 'decentralized.' This post has been inspired by a few conversations and two articles that have recently surfaced."
