[A Brief History of Digital Currencies]
Link = ["https://ebrary.net/7927/education/brief_history_digital_currencies"]
Description = "A Brief History of Digital Currencies\n\nThe birth of the Internet led many, including economist Milton Friedman, to assume that the invention of some sort of digital money would soon follow. Arguments in favor of digital money were numerous. One obvious benefit realized early on was that it might help prevent counterfeiting:\n\nThe advent of high-quality color copiers threatens the security of paper money. The demands of guarding it make paper money expensive. The hassles of handling it (such as vending machines) make paper money undesirable. The use of credit cards and ATM cards is becoming increasingly popular, but those systems lack adequate privacy or security against fraud, resulting in a demand for efficient electronic-money systems to prevent fraud and also to protect user privacy.\n\n—Jorg Kienzle and Adrian Perrig in 'Digital Money: A divine gift or Satan's malicious tool?' (1996)"

Along came bitcoin, a radically different proposal for a decentralized cryptocurrency that did not need the banks, and digital cash finally succeeded."

Many tried a cryptographed digital currency before it, and they weren't able to fully crack it. Since Bitcoin became a reality nearly a decade ago, there have been some high highs and some low lows. For some Bitcoin owners, that's part of the appeal.\n\nBut how did we get to where we are today with Bitcoin? How did it begin, what were its forebearers, and what have been the unexpected turns of the Bitcoin journey? Let's take a walk through the timeline and find out."

Looking further back to a world before cash and central banks, there were multiple ‘currencies' operating at the level of communities, and the use of barter for transactions. Perhaps technology will take us back to the future, a future that began back in 1971, when money became a claim backed by reputation rather than by physical commodities of any kind. Since then, money has been bits. The author shows that these phenomena are not only possible in the future, but already upon us."

The invocation or assumption in a security protocol design of a 'trusted third party' (TTP) or a 'trusted computing base' (TCB) controlled by a third party constitutes the introduction of a security hole into that design.

Prominent among them is the discussion on what to call 1 billion Bitcoin, which symbol color to use for it, and when wallet clients should switch to it by default.\n\nTo combat this, this document proposes a controversial change: making Bitcoin's monetary supply finite."
