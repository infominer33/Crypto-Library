Description = "Arguably the first coin to introduce Proof of Stake as an alternative to Proof of Work\n\nA peer-to-peer crypto-currency design derived from Satoshi Nakamoto’s Bitcoin. Proof-of-stake  replaces  proof-of-work  to  provide  most  of  the  network  security. Under  this  hybrid  design  proof-of-work  mainly  provides  initial  minting  and  is largely  non-essential  in  the  long  run.  Security  level  of  the network  is  not dependent  on  energy  consumption  in  the  long  term  thus  providing  an  energy-efficient  and  more  cost-competitive  peer-to-peer  crypto-currency.  Proof-of-stake is  based  on  coin  age  and  generated  by  each  node  via  a  hashing  scheme  bearing similarity  to  Bitcoin’s  but  over  limited  search  space.  Block  chain  history  and transaction settlement are further protected by a centrally broadcasted checkpoint mechanism. "

Description = "The concept behind Proof-of-Stake is that a block chain should be secured by those with a financial interest in the chain. This paper will introduce a new approach to Proof-of-Stake that utilizes coin-days-destroyed by every transaction as a substitute for the vast majority of the security currently provided by Proof-of-Work. Unlike prior Proof-of-Stake systems in which only some nodes contribute to the proof-of-stake calculation, we present a new approach to Proof-of-Stake whereby all nodes generating transactions contribute to the security of the network. We speculate that such a network would be immune to known attacks against Bitcoin or Peercoin."

Reddcoin can also function as the unit of account in heterogeneous social context.  The technological aspects of PoSV are presented after a detailed review of existing designs.  The economic aspects of Reddcoin are then analysed.  Finally the unique position of Reddcoin as a digital social currency in the competitive landscape of cryptocurrencies is discussed."

Description = "In a previous paper, it was discussed whether Bitcoin and/or its blockchain could be considered a complex system and, if so, whether a chaotic one, a positive response raising concerns about the likelihood of Bitcoin/blockchain entering a chaotic regime, with catastrophic consequences for  financial systems based on it. This paper intends to simplify and extend that analysis to other PoW, PoS, and hybrid protocol-based cryptocurrencies. As before, this study was carried out ith the help of Information Theory of Complex Systems, in general, and Crutchfield’s Statistical Complexity measure, in particular.  This paper is a work in progress. Whereas PoW consensus was shown to be highly noncomplex, the Nxt PoS consensus method studied shows an outstandingly higher measure of complexity, which is undesirable because it introduces unnecessary complexity into what should be a simple computational system. This paper is a work - in - progress and undoubtedly prone to incorrectness as a few cryptocurrencies may have changed their consensus algorithms. As next step, we intend to uncover some other measures that capture the qualitative notion of complexity of systems that can be applied to these cryptocurrencies to compare with the results he re obtained. As a final thought, however, considering that a certain amount of chaoticity may have been potentially introduced in the Bitcoin market by the presence of the capital gains seekers, one could wonder whether the recent surge of blockchain technology based startups, even discounting all the scam cases, could not help to reduce non-linearity and prevent chaos"

To avoid a single point of failure, this ledger is authenticated using a dynamic membership multiparty signature (DMMS) consisting of an expensive (but cheaply verifiable) computation done on the entire ledger history every “heartbeat”.\nUnlike a traditional digital signature, there is no notion of “forgeability” for a DMMS. Instead, every DMMS is costly to produce (in Bitcoin, by requiring a large energy expenditure) and rewarded by introduction of new coins on the ledger.  Since these coins are only useful if others recognize them, participants are incentivized to extend one “true ledger” rather than attempting to create their own version of history"

Description = "blockchain constitutes a distributed ledger that records transactions across a network  of  agents.   Blockchain’s  value  proposition  requires  that  agents  eventually  agree on the ledger’s contents since payments possess risk otherwise.  Restricted blockchains ensure this consensus by appointing a central authority to dictate payment validity.  Permissionless blockchains (e.g.  Bitcoin, Ethereum), however, admit no central authority and  therefore  face  a  non-trivial  issue  of  inducing  consensus  endogenously.   Nakamoto (2008) provided a temporary solution to the problem by invoking an economic mechanism known as Proof-of-Work (PoW). PoW, however, lacks sustainability, so, in recent years,  a  variety  of  alternatives  have  been  proposed.   This  paper  studies  the  most  famous such alternative, Proof-of-Stake (PoS). I provide the first formal economic model of  PoS and  demonstrate  that PoS induces  consensus  in equilibrium.   My result  arises because I endogenize blockchain coin prices.  Propagating disagreement introduces risk and thereby reduces blockchain coin value which implies that stake-holders face an implicit cost from delaying consensus.  PoS randomly selects a stake-holder to update the blockchain and provides her an explicit monetary incentive, a “block reward,” for her service.  In the event of disagreement, block rewards constitute a perverse incentive, but I demonstrate that restricting updating ability to large stake-holders induces an equilibrium in which consensus obtains as soon as possible.  I also demonstrate that consensus obtains eventually almost surely in any equilibrium so long as the blockchain employs a modest block reward schedule.  My work reveals the economic viability of permissionless blockchains."

Description = "Not sure if these papers should be posted to this forum (my instinct is that they should!), but trying it as an experiment (instead of just discussing on Twitter).\n\nAt a conceptual level, the barriers stem from the following: all cryptocurrencies require some source of (pseudo)randomness. In Proof-of-Work, this pseudorandomness is in some sense external to the cryptocurrency: the first miner to successfully find a good nonce produces the next block, and this miner is selected completely independently of the current state of the cryptocurrency. In Proof-of-Stake, it is highly desirable that the pseudorandomness comes from within the cryptocurrency itself, versus an external source (due to network security concerns discussed in Section 2). One might initially suspect that with sufficiently many hashes or digital signatures of past blocks, this can indeed serve as a good source of pseudorandomness for future blocks. However, we formalize surprising barriers showing a fundamental difference between external pseudorandomness and pseudorandomness coming from the cryptocurrency itself."

In PoS-based public blockchains (e.g. Ethereum's upcoming Casper implementation), a set of validators take turns proposing and voting on the next block, and the weight of each validator's vote depends on the size of its deposit (i.e. stake). Significant advantages of PoS include security, reduced risk of centralization, and energy efficiency."

["Compounding of Wealth in Proof-of-Stake Cryptocurrencies"]
Link = ["https://arxiv.org/pdf/1809.07468.pdf"]
Description = "Abstract. Proof-of-stake (PoS) is a promising approach for designing efficient blockchains, where block proposers are randomly chosen with probability proportional to their stake. A primary concern with PoS systems is the “rich getting richer” phenomenon, whereby wealthier nodes are more likely to get elected, and hence reap the block reward, making them even wealthier. In this paper, we introduce the notion of equitability, which quantifies how much a proposer can amplify her stake compared to her initial investment. Even with everyone following protocol (i.e., honest behavior), we show that existing methods of allocating block rewards lead to poor equitability, as does initializing systems with small stake pools and/or large rewards relative to the stake pool. We identify a geometric reward function, which we prove is maximally equitable over all choices of reward functions under honest behavior and bound the deviation for strategic actions; the proofs involve the study of optimization problems and stochastic  dominances  of  P ́olya  urn  processes,  and  are  of  independent  mathematical  interest.  These results allow us to provide a systematic framework to choose the parameters of a practical incentive system for PoS cryptocurrencies."

Rather, Slasher is a useful construct to have in our war chest in case proof of stake mining becomes substantially more popular or a compelling reason is provided to switch. Slasher may also benefit other cryptocurrencies that wish to exist independently of Ethereum. Special thanks to tacotime for some inspiration, and for Jack Walker for improvement suggestions."

["History of Casper —Part 1"]
Link = ["https://medium.com/@Vlad_Zamfir/the-history-of-casper-part-1-59233819c9a9"]
Description = "Vitalik suggested last week that I share my basic research and design philosophy in a blog post, I agreed but complained that it was still changing. My friend Jon West told me that everyone would really appreciate it if I told everyone about my Casper research, I mostly agreed. Then someone on reddit told me to focus on Ethereum.\n\nSo here’s the Casper tech story, given as a chronological history of the evolution of the key technology, ideas and language that are involved in “Casper research”. Many of our favorite blockchain personalities are part of the story. This is my attempt to recount everything in an accessible, sequential way so that you can see where we are now (and where we’re going) with our research efforts (so don’t argue until the end of the story!). I’m going to try to release a chapter per day until it’s complete."

Description = "This chapter describes the game theory and economic security modelling we were doing in the Fall of 2014. It recounts how the “bribing attacker model” led our research directly to a radical solution to the long range attack problem."

["History of Casper —Part 3"]
Link = ["https://medium.com/@Vlad_Zamfir/the-history-of-casper-chapter-3-70fefb1182fc"]
Description = "This chapter describes our proof-of-stake research during the period starting after the discovery of the solution to the long-range attack problem and ending when we first became aware of the existence and relevance of traditional, pre-blockchain consensus research.\n\nThis “wild west” period is characterized by wide experimentation, exploration, and ignorance. Much of this chapter is therefore a collection of relatively disorganized protocol ideas. The period’s end is marked by my getting kicked out of a Financial Cryptography mailing list, and by my consequently learning about (and immediately becoming a fan of) Jae Kwon’s Tendermint."

Link = ["https://medium.com/@Vlad_Zamfir/the-history-of-casper-chapter-4-3855638b5f0e"]
Description = "This chapter describes the events that led to a fundamental change in our economic modeling assumptions. These changes represent the foundation of the methodologies that underlie the analysis and architecture that we are working hard to develop at the Ethereum research team (at least for the Casper and Sharding efforts). The design philosophy presented in this chapter (imho) strongly differentiates the work we’re doing at Ethereum from the work being done by every other project in the space."

Description = "In this chapter I recount the story of Casper’s birth as an application of the principles of Aviv Zohar and Jonatan Sompolinsky’s GHOST to proof-of-stake.\n\nI called it “the friendly ghost” because of incentives designed to guarantee censorship resistance against the oligopolists: incentives that force the cartel to be friendly to non-cartel validators."

Description = "In the last post in this series, we discussed one of the two flagship feature sets of Serenity: a heightened degree of abstraction that greatly increases the flexibility of the platform and takes a large step in moving Ethereum from \"Bitcoin plus Turing-complete\" to \"general-purpose decentralized computation\". Now, let us turn our attention to the other flagship feature, and the one for which the Serenity milestone was originally created: the Casper proof of stake algorithm."

Description = "Last week Yoichi released a blog post detailing the process of formally proving safety and liveness properties of my “minimal slashing conditions”. This is a key component of a Byzantine-fault-tolerant, safe-under-asynchrony and cryptoeconomically safe consensus algorithm that is at the core of my proof of stake roadmap. In this post I want to provide further details on what this algorithm is, what its significance is, and how it generally fits into proof of stake research."

["Alpha Casper FFG Testnet Instructions"]
Link = ["https://hackmd.io/s/Hk6UiFU7z#"]
Description = "Welcome to the first release of the alpha Casper FFG testnet, built on pyethereum. This network represents the result of years of work on cryptoeconomic proof-of-stake and months of active development of the client, and is a fully-featured and usable network, allowing users to send transactions, mine and become validators. However, this is still several steps away from a network that will be ready for launch. Some parameters are set differently from the intended final settings, and the currently only available client, pyethereum, has a much lower processing capacity than clients implemented in faster languages; as a result, network parameters will be heavily restricted to ensure network sustainability. Do not expect performance equivalent to test networks operated by more performant clients such as Geth and Parity."

["Ethereum Casper 101"]
Link = ["https://medium.com/@jonchoi/ethereum-casper-101-7a851a4f1eb0"]
Description = "tl;dr Casper will implement proof of stake in Ethereum. We begin with a review on why proof of stake matters and continue with its strengths & weaknesses. This post aims to provide a broad overview of Casper and clarify some of the confusion with respect to the two protocol design efforts related to Casper. The two proposed implementations share the same core design principle: applying cryptoeconomic mechanism design to secure the network while managing challenges regarding liveness, safety and synchrony assumptions. This post is also an overview of the progress so far and the challenges that lie ahead. Most importantly for fellow newcomers, the post identifies & defines key concepts and ties together various helpful resources under one context. The overarching intention is to make Casper and proof of stake more approachable to everyone in the community."

Description = "Suppose that you have a PoS chain, where there is some validator set V, and where blocks are subdivided into epochs of length EpochLength; you want every validator to vote once in every epoch as this is important for the consensus cycle and to minimize any gains from RNG manipulation. There is a source of random entropy in the chain; suppose that the random entropy updates once per epoch. At the start of every epoch, we randomly shuffle V and partition it into slices S1...SEpochLength, each of size SSize=VEpochLength, and we split up activity into consecutive time slots T1...TEpochLength."

["On Chain Randomness is hard — 'RANDAO beacon exploitability analysis, round 2'"]
Link = ["https://ethresear.ch/t/randao-beacon-exploitability-analysis-round-2/1980"]
Description = "Let us suppose that, for pure proof of stake, the main chain uses a simple RANDAO-based RNG. That is, the main chain has an internal state, R, and every validator, upon depositing, commits to the innermost value in a hash onion, H(H(H(.....S.....))); the state stores the “current commitment value” CVi for each validator Vi. To create a block, a validator Vi must include the preimage of the CVi value (call it H−1(CVi)), and the following state changes happen: (i) CVi:=H−1(CVi), (ii) R:=R xor H−1(CVi); that is, the current commitment value for that validator is set to the preimage, so next time the validator will have to unwrap another layer of the onion and reveal the preimage of that, and the preimage is incorporated into R."
