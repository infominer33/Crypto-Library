Description = "Arguably the first coin to introduce Proof of Stake as an alternative to Proof of Work\n\nA peer-to-peer crypto-currency design derived from Satoshi Nakamoto’s Bitcoin. Proof-of-stake  replaces  proof-of-work  to  provide  most  of  the  network  security. Under  this  hybrid  design  proof-of-work  mainly  provides  initial  minting  and  is largely  non-essential  in  the  long  run.  Security  level  of  the network  is  not dependent  on  energy  consumption  in  the  long  term  thus  providing  an  energy-efficient  and  more  cost-competitive  peer-to-peer  crypto-currency.  Proof-of-stake is  based  on  coin  age  and  generated  by  each  node  via  a  hashing  scheme  bearing similarity  to  Bitcoin’s  but  over  limited  search  space.  Block  chain  history  and transaction settlement are further protected by a centrally broadcasted checkpoint mechanism. "

Description = "The concept behind Proof-of-Stake is that a block chain should be secured by those with a financial interest in the chain. This paper will introduce a new approach to Proof-of-Stake that utilizes coin-days-destroyed by every transaction as a substitute for the vast majority of the security currently provided by Proof-of-Work. Unlike prior Proof-of-Stake systems in which only some nodes contribute to the proof-of-stake calculation, we present a new approach to Proof-of-Stake whereby all nodes generating transactions contribute to the security of the network. We speculate that such a network would be immune to known attacks against Bitcoin or Peercoin."

DPOS leverages the power of stakeholder approval voting to resolve consensus issues in a fair and democratic way. All network parameters, from fee schedules to block intervals and transaction sizes, can be tuned via elected delegates. Deterministic selection of block producers allows transactions to be confirmed in an average of just 1 second. Perhaps most importantly, the consensus protocol is designed to protect all participants against unwanted regulatory interference. "

PoSV is designed to encourage both ownership (Stake) and activity (Velocity) which directly correspond to the two main functions of Reddcoin as a real currency: store of value and medium of exchange.  Reddcoin can also function as the unit of account in heterogeneous social context.  The technological aspects of PoSV are presented after a detailed review of existing designs.  The economic aspects of Reddcoin are then analysed.  Finally the unique position of Reddcoin as a digital social currency in the competitive landscape of cryptocurrencies is discussed."

Description = "In a previous paper, it was discussed whether Bitcoin and/or its blockchain could be considered a complex system and, if so, whether a chaotic one, a positive response raising concerns about the likelihood of Bitcoin/blockchain entering a chaotic regime, with catastrophic consequences for  financial systems based on it. This paper intends to simplify and extend that analysis to other PoW, PoS, and hybrid protocol-based cryptocurrencies. As before, this study was carried out ith the help of Information Theory of Complex Systems, in general, and Crutchfield’s Statistical Complexity measure, in particular.  This paper is a work in progress. Whereas PoW consensus was shown to be highly noncomplex, the Nxt PoS consensus method studied shows an outstandingly higher measure of complexity, which is undesirable because it introduces unnecessary complexity into what should be a simple computational system. This paper is a work - in - progress and undoubtedly prone to incorrectness as a few cryptocurrencies may have changed their consensus algorithms. As next step, we intend to uncover some other measures that capture the qualitative notion of complexity of systems that can be applied to these cryptocurrencies to compare with the results he re obtained. As a final thought, however, considering that a certain amount of chaoticity may have been potentially introduced in the Bitcoin market by the presence of the capital gains seekers, one could wonder whether the recent surge of blockchain technology based startups, even discounting all the scam cases, could not help to reduce non-linearity and prevent chaos"

To ensure a consistent view of token ownership, Nakamoto used a public ledger which can be replicated and validated by all network participants.  To avoid a single point of failure, this ledger is authenticated using a dynamic membership multiparty signature (DMMS) consisting of an expensive (but cheaply verifiable) computation done on the entire ledger history every “heartbeat”.\nUnlike a traditional digital signature, there is no notion of “forgeability” for a DMMS. Instead, every DMMS is costly to produce (in Bitcoin, by requiring a large energy expenditure) and rewarded by introduction of new coins on the ledger.  Since these coins are only useful if others recognize them, participants are incentivized to extend one “true ledger” rather than attempting to create their own version of history"

Description = "blockchain constitutes a distributed ledger that records transactions across a network  of  agents.   Blockchain’s  value  proposition  requires  that  agents  eventually  agree on the ledger’s contents since payments possess risk otherwise.  Restricted blockchains ensure this consensus by appointing a central authority to dictate payment validity.  Permissionless blockchains (e.g.  Bitcoin, Ethereum), however, admit no central authority and  therefore  face  a  non-trivial  issue  of  inducing  consensus  endogenously.   Nakamoto (2008) provided a temporary solution to the problem by invoking an economic mechanism known as Proof-of-Work (PoW). PoW, however, lacks sustainability, so, in recent years,  a  variety  of  alternatives  have  been  proposed.   This  paper  studies  the  most  famous such alternative, Proof-of-Stake (PoS). I provide the first formal economic model of  PoS and  demonstrate  that PoS induces  consensus  in equilibrium.   My result  arises because I endogenize blockchain coin prices.  Propagating disagreement introduces risk and thereby reduces blockchain coin value which implies that stake-holders face an implicit cost from delaying consensus.  PoS randomly selects a stake-holder to update the blockchain and provides her an explicit monetary incentive, a “block reward,” for her service.  In the event of disagreement, block rewards constitute a perverse incentive, but I demonstrate that restricting updating ability to large stake-holders induces an equilibrium in which consensus obtains as soon as possible.  I also demonstrate that consensus obtains eventually almost surely in any equilibrium so long as the blockchain employs a modest block reward schedule.  My work reveals the economic viability of permissionless blockchains."

Description = "Not sure if these papers should be posted to this forum (my instinct is that they should!), but trying it as an experiment (instead of just discussing on Twitter).\n\nAt a conceptual level, the barriers stem from the following: all cryptocurrencies require some source of (pseudo)randomness. In Proof-of-Work, this pseudorandomness is in some sense external to the cryptocurrency: the first miner to successfully find a good nonce produces the next block, and this miner is selected completely independently of the current state of the cryptocurrency. In Proof-of-Stake, it is highly desirable that the pseudorandomness comes from within the cryptocurrency itself, versus an external source (due to network security concerns discussed in Section 2). One might initially suspect that with sufficiently many hashes or digital signatures of past blocks, this can indeed serve as a good source of pseudorandomness for future blocks. However, we formalize surprising barriers showing a fundamental difference between external pseudorandomness and pseudorandomness coming from the cryptocurrency itself."

In PoS-based public blockchains (e.g. Ethereum's upcoming Casper implementation), a set of validators take turns proposing and voting on the next block, and the weight of each validator's vote depends on the size of its deposit (i.e. stake). Significant advantages of PoS include security, reduced risk of centralization, and energy efficiency."

It requires a good number of them to be online and maintain sufficiently good network connectivity that they can collect transactions and have their PoS blocks reach the others without substantial network delays. It follows that any PoS ledger would benefit from reliable server nodes that hold stake and focus on maintenance."

["Compounding of Wealth in Proof-of-Stake Cryptocurrencies"]
Link = ["https://arxiv.org/pdf/1809.07468.pdf"]
Description = "Abstract. Proof-of-stake (PoS) is a promising approach for designing efficient blockchains, where block proposers are randomly chosen with probability proportional to their stake. A primary concern with PoS systems is the “rich getting richer” phenomenon, whereby wealthier nodes are more likely to get elected, and hence reap the block reward, making them even wealthier. In this paper, we introduce the notion of equitability, which quantifies how much a proposer can amplify her stake compared to her initial investment. Even with everyone following protocol (i.e., honest behavior), we show that existing methods of allocating block rewards lead to poor equitability, as does initializing systems with small stake pools and/or large rewards relative to the stake pool. We identify a geometric reward function, which we prove is maximally equitable over all choices of reward functions under honest behavior and bound the deviation for strategic actions; the proofs involve the study of optimization problems and stochastic  dominances  of  P ́olya  urn  processes,  and  are  of  independent  mathematical  interest.  These results allow us to provide a systematic framework to choose the parameters of a practical incentive system for PoS cryptocurrencies."
