  "A Look At Smart Contracts, Use cases and DApps": {
    "Description": "Smart contracts are self-executing code that defines and executes an agreement between multiple parties. That code contains simple \u201cif/when\u2026then\u2026\u201d statements executed within a distributed network that achieves consensus on transactions made within it. For example, a smart contract could define conditions for a payment from party A to party B, and other conditions for returning the funds back to party A; perhaps after a certain amount of time passed without the first conditions being met. This innovation allows for the elimination of trusted intermediaries in a wide range of programmable agreements. Smart contract enabled transactions are fully traceable, transparent, and irreversible.",

Most articles explain Blockchain only related to cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin without giving a clear idea of how it works (what is the consensus protocol, how are the blocks validated, how to get bitcoins, \u2026). We\u2019ll answer these questions here.\nMost articles don\u2019t talk about the other types of blockchains that are currently populating the internet and coming up in many conversations between CEOs. These are the private/federated ones. Below you will find answers to what these are, and how they are different from public blockchain networks (like Bitcoin or Ethereum).",

    "Description": "This paper explains the functioning of \u201cblockchain technology\u201d and critically assesses its potential role in improving services in banking, contracts, and database systems. Comparing blockchain to the current best practice technology in these fields reveals several barriers to successful commercial implementation: Blockchain technology involves costly redundancies and irreversibility, faces serious scaling problems and significant barriers to complying with regulations, and is a security liability unless secured with its own freely trading currency. A survey of the state of the blockchain industry shows that in eight years since blockchain technology was invented, it has had no commercial applications other than digital cash. The paper concludes that a blockchain is a peculiar engineering design whose only advantage is in removing third party intermediation to allow for the creation of digital cash, and is unlikely to offer economic advantages for any commercial problem other than the one it was specifically engineered to solve.

    "Description": "Many different use cases have been proposed for blockchains, relating to financial assets, health records, identity management and supply chains.

By that I mean either big iron behemoths like Oracle and SQL Server, or for the more adventurous and open-minded, MySQL and Postgres. So before we even start talking about blockchains, it\u2019s important to set one thing straight:\n\nIf your requirements are fulfilled by today\u2019s relational databases, you\u2019d be insane to use a blockchain.",
