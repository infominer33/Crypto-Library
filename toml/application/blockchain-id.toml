Description = "Identity and control of personal identity is top of mind, given recent events as well as the European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). A lot of our identity is shared without our explicit consent, gets stored in locations we are unaware of, and when compromised creates tremendous setbacks. Almost everything we do in the digital world is user name and password driven. With decentralized identity, you reduce risk by associating credentials typically used for in-person interactions, as instruments for virtual interactions where it is difficult to verify who or what is on the other side of the screen."

Transactional data stored on a blockchain, whether in plain text, encrypted form or after having undergone a hashing process, constitutes personal data for the purposes of the GDPR. Public keys equally qualify as personal data as a matter of EU data protection law. We examine the consequences flowing from that state of affairs and suggest that in interpreting the GDPR with respect to blockchains, fundamental rights protection and the promotion of innovation, two normative objectives of the European legal order, must be reconciled. This is even more so given that, where designed appropriately, distributed ledgers have the potential to further the GDPR’s objective of data sovereignty."

Description = "Abstract—Digital identity is unsolved: after many years of research there is still no trusted communication over the Internet. To provide identity within the context of mutual distrust, this paper presents a blockchain-based digital identity solution. Without depending upon a single trusted third party, the proposed solution achieves passport-level legally valid identity. This solution for making identities Self-Sovereign, builds on a generic provable claim model for which attestations of truth from third parties need to be collected. The claim model is then shown to be both blockchain structure and proof method agnostic. Four different implementations in support of these two claim model properties are shown to offer sub-second performance for claim creation and claim verification. Through the properties of Self-Sovereign Identity, legally valid status and acceptable performance, our solution is considered to be fit for adoption by the general public."

The emergence of distributed ledger technology (DLT) based upon a blockchain data structure, has given rise to new approaches to identity management that aim to upend dominant approaches to providing and consuming digital identities. These new approaches to identity management (IdM) propose to enhance decentralisation, transparency and user control in transactions that involve identity information; but, given the historical challenge to design IdM, can these new DLTbased schemes deliver on their lofty goals? We introduce the emerging landscape of DLT-based IdM, and evaluate three representative proposals – uPort, ShoCard and Sovrin – using the analytic lens of a seminal framework that characterises the nature of successful IdM schemes."]

Each DID Document contains at least three things: cryptographic material, authentication suites, and service endpoints. Cryptographic material combined with authentication suites provide a set of mechanisms to authenticate as the DID subject (e.g., public keys, pseudonymous biometric protocols, etc.). Service endpoints enable trusted interactions with the DID subject.\n\nThis document specifies a common data model, format, and operations that all DIDs support."

DID Auth includes the ability to establish mutually authenticated communication channels and to authenticate to web sites and applications.

Although the technical details of DID Auth are not well-defined at this point, its general concept is clear: With self-sovereign identity infrastructure, the most trivial and straightforward functionality for identity owners should be the ability to authenticate, i.e. to prove control of a DID in some relationship or during a transaction. This could take place using a number of different data formats, protocols, and flows. DID Auth includes the ability to authenticate to web sites and applications, and to establish mutually authenticated communication channels. In this webinar, we will discuss the current state of the DID Auth concept, and how it relates to other efforts such as Verifiable Credentials and agent protocols.

Description = "There are many ways to approach identity. For the Rebooting Web of Trust, we prefer a functional approach to focus conversations on how identity works and how we use it.\n\nThe varied facets of identity are so rich that we each bring our own hot buttons and agendas to any discussion. Some people engage from a philosophical perspective, others cultural. Some dive into political issues and others get meta-physical and spiritual. These different perspectives are valid views of identity’s impact on our lives. More than valid. Vital. They help answer the question of “Why?” Why identity matters, why we should care. Unfortunately, they also inflame passions. We sometimes talk past each other to make points that have minimal relevance for others, leaving people frustrated and unheard.\n\nAs engineers and system designers, we’re concerned with how things work. We want to fix what’s broken and build new things. To do that, we want to discuss how things function. With identity, this functional perspective sidesteps the inflammatory rabbit holes, without dismissing them. Functional Identity lets us investigate the HOW without prejudice to WHY, viewing identity systems based on how they work and then, in turn, how they affect individuals and society."

Description = "In a world where the rise in the use of the Internet is increasing exponentially, the ability to prove your identity is crucial for the economic, financial and social development. Individuals and companies need identity solutions valid across different services, markets, standards and technologies. New technologies like blockchain, biometrics and AI can help to deliver secure identity services, in particular by governments and financial institutions, and solutions should meet both the objectives of ensuring secure identity and improving user experience. As public identities have been created by different authorities, and since a global public or private identity is not a realistic option in the short term, interoperability and the collaboration between different entities to offer complete solutions is decisive. In the long run, to become a trusted identity provider across different industries could represent a big business opportunity for financial institutions."

Description = "Situation: Information management enables humanitarian organizations to make adequate interventions based on timely, appropriate and trustworthy information. A crucial type of information are identities, because they can be used to assess vulnerability and efficiently manage aid distribution. Vulnerability determines who receives aid first because resources are always limited. This information is increasingly being stored and processed in identity systems. Complication: Most identity systems are centralized and produce analogue proofs of identity such as passports or ID cards. These systems are susceptible to privacy and data breaches. Centralization leads to single-points-of-failure and could lead to fraudulent behavior resulting in people lacking formal proofs of identity. In general there is limited interoperability between identity systems and limited collaboration between the owners of these systems. Approach: To create an interoperable and shared digital identity system using a Design Science Research strategy and systems engineering approach. This system must be distributed, protect privacy and put the identity owner in control of his or her data. The foundation of the system consists of Humanitarian Information Management principles, Privacy-by-Design principles and Self-Sovereign Identity principles. This research creates a functional blockchain based system, that enables identities for the use-case of Cash Transfer Programs. Results: We present a validated set of ten design decisions that represent the trade-offs that have been made and prescribe a blueprint for a technical design. Next steps: Future research should be done on how such a system could be implemented and used. This would require a process design approach that has to be developed, Also, elaborate research into user experience and user interfaces should be conducted."

Description = "First, PoA was proposed by a group of developers in March 2017 (the term was coined by Gavin Wood) as a blockchain based on the Ethereum protocol. It was developed primarily as a solution to the problem of spam attacks on Ethereum’s Ropsten test network. The new network was named Kovan and is a primary test network available to all Ethereum users today.\n\nPoA consensus is essentially an optimized Proof of Stake model that leverages identity as the form of stake rather than actually staking tokens. The identity is staked by a group of validators (authorities) that are pre-approved to validate transactions and blocks within the respective network. The group of validators is usually supposed to remain fairly small (~25 or less) in order to ensure efficiency and manageable security of the network."

Description = "I have this notion of “self-sovereign identity” coming forward. A notion which was developed by Christopher Allen in his influential 2016 essay \“The path to self-sovereign identity\”. In his essay, Christopher Allen defined self-sovereign identity as a decentralized identity where the user is not only central to the administration of his identity, but also has autonomy over his own identity. Allen sees self-sovereign identity as a \“lifetime portable digital identity for any person, organization, or thing that does not depend on any centralized authority and can never be taken away\”. It means that the identity is not controlled by any centralized authority that offers it as an authentication mechanism, and is truly owned, controlled and managed by a unique individual."

This decentralized public key infrastructure (DPKI) could have as much impact on global cybersecurity and cyberprivacy as the development of the SSL/TLS protocol for encrypted Web traffic (now the largest PKI in the world)."

For us, births and deaths are routinely and accurately documented. Yet more than 100 developing countries lack functional civil registration and vital statistics (CRVS) systems, and 230 million children under the age of five haven’t been registered. Some countries like Malawi and Ethiopia have registration rates in the single digits. Experts estimate that there are 1.5 billion people without a legal identity.

Description = "Digital identity is one of the oldest and hardest problems on the Internet. There is still no way to use digital credentials to prove our online identity the same way we do in the offline world. This is finally changing. First, the World Wide Web Consortium is standardizing the format of digitally-signed credentials. Secondly, public blockchains can provide decentralized registration and discovery of the public keys needed to verify digital signatures. These two steps pave the way to establish a global public utility for self-sovereign identity—lifetime portable digital identity that does not depend on any central authority and can never be taken away. The Sovrin Network has been designed exclusively for this purpose, including governance (the Sovrin Foundation and the Sovrin Trust Framework), scalability (validator and observer nodes and state proofs), and accessibility (minimal cost and maximum availability). Most importantly, Sovrin implements Privacy by Design on a global scale, including pairwise pseudonymous identifiers, peer-to-peer private agents, and selective disclosure of personal data using zero-knowledge proof cryptography. The emergence of this infrastructure can transform at least four major markets: identity and access management, cybersecurity, RegTech, and data integration. To provide economic incentives for credential issuers, owners, and verifiers, the Sovrin protocol will incorporate a digital token designed expressly for privacy-preserving value exchange. The Sovrin token should enable a global marketplace for digital credentials of all types and value levels together with ancillary markets for digital credential insurance and permissioned first party data (direct from the customer)"
