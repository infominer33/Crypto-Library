My first page besides "home" with the minimal mistakes theme. All of my pages will migrate to minimal mistakes, once I get the feel for it.

## Wish List

* some simple way to check [infominer.id/DIDecentralized](https://infominer.id/DIDecentralized) against these lists, and output a list of links that have yet to be included.

* an app that will take a list of links as the input and output a toml file with title\description automatically populated based on metadata..

that would make it a lot easier.. then I just go in and fine tune each entry.

I suppose it would make the most sense to prioritize those objectives, rather than constructing everything by hand.

## blockchain-id.toml

* [SourceCrypto/toml/application/blockchain-id.toml](https://github.com/infominer33/SourceCrypto/blob/master/toml/application/blockchain-id.toml)

## blockchain-id2.toml
