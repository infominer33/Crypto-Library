Now I need an app (or some simple way) to check [infominer.id/DIDecentralized](https://infominer.id/DIDecentralized) against these lists, and output a list of links that have yet to be included (along with title an description would be dope).

Now what I'm thinking I need is an app that will take a list of links as the input and output a toml file with title\description automatically populated based on metadata..

that would make it a lot easier.. then I just go in and fine tune each entry.
