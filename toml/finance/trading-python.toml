["Algorithmic trading in less than 100 lines of Python code"]
Link = ["https://www.oreilly.com/learning/algorithmic-trading-in-less-than-100-lines-of-python-code"]
Description = "Algorithmic trading refers to the computerized, automated trading of financial instruments (based on some algorithm or rule) with little or no human intervention during trading hours. Almost any kind of financial instrument — be it stocks, currencies, commodities, credit products or volatility — can be traded in such a fashion. Not only that, in certain market segments, algorithms are responsible for the lion’s share of the trading volume. The books The Quants by Scott Patterson and More Money Than God by Sebastian Mallaby paint a vivid picture of the beginnings of algorithmic trading and the personalities behind its rise."

Description = "A comprehensive guide to professional grade algo strategies. The book is concise and to the point. The author provides matlab code which I did not test. While the book describes statistical tools in good detail, in my view experienced systems developers get more value from it than those who are just starting out. I recommend the book to both new traders and pros. New traders can use the book as a good starting point in their research. Pros can use the tools described in the book to enhance their existing strategies."
