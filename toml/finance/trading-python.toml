Description = "Algorithmic trading refers to the computerized, automated trading of financial instruments (based on some algorithm or rule) with little or no human intervention during trading hours. Almost any kind of financial instrument — be it stocks, currencies, commodities, credit products or volatility — can be traded in such a fashion. Not only that, in certain market segments, algorithms are responsible for the lion’s share of the trading volume. The books The Quants by Scott Patterson and More Money Than God by Sebastian Mallaby paint a vivid picture of the beginnings of algorithmic trading and the personalities behind its rise."

Both of them satisfy many of the wishes described above, but they have some important differences. Matlab is most popular when it comes to technical computing. This is what I used to use day-to-day for solving engineering problems. For numeric simulations and working with \"clean\" data, it is probably the best tool there is.

Description = "Over the last months, I’ve explored ways not only to invest in crypto but also maximizing the profits from it. One of the first ideas that came to my mind was to develop an automatic trading bot to perform a type of trading known as arbitrage. Although there are different subtypes of arbitrage, in my case, essentially consisted in finding two cryptocurrency exchanges and profit from divergences in their exchange prices. For instance, with enough patience, the automatic trader could find an opportunity where one could sell 1 Bitcoin for 8000 dollars in GDAX and buy 1 Bitcoin for 7950 dollars in Kraken with a profit margin of 50$. Although the concept is of a magnificent simplicity, the reality is that the algorithm could become exponentially complex when one started to introduce fancy high-frequency limit orders (instead of market orders) trying to outperform a ferocious competition equipped with low-latency internet connections and besieging the exchanges from the nearer buildings. The result: an arbitrage nightmare and a waste of time supervising the algorithm performance for very little revenue. My conclusion: can be an interesting project for a full-time dedicated PhD student willing to mingle with a Frankenstein Python code."

Despite this, the choice of available programming languages is large and diverse, which can often be overwhelming.

I also ended up writing a fairly flexible trading bot in Python which I wanted to share. (You can find it on GitHub.)"

["ANALYZING CRYPTOCURRENCY MARKETS USING PYTHON"]
Link = ["https://blog.patricktriest.com/analyzing-cryptocurrencies-python/"] 
Description = "A DATA-DRIVEN APPROACH TO CRYPTOCURRENCY SPECULATION\nHow do Bitcoin markets behave? What are the causes of the sudden spikes and dips in cryptocurrency values? Are the markets for different altcoins inseparably linked or largely independent? How can we predict what will happen next?\n\nArticles on cryptocurrencies, such as Bitcoin and Ethereum, are rife with speculation these days, with hundreds of self-proclaimed experts advocating for the trends that they expect to emerge. What is lacking from many of these analyses is a strong foundation of data and statistics to backup the claims.\n\nThe goal of this article is to provide an easy introduction to cryptocurrency analysis using Python. We will walk through a simple Python script to retrieve, analyze, and visualize data on different cryptocurrencies. In the process, we will uncover an interesting trend in how these volatile markets behave, and how they are evolving."

["Best Bitcoin Trading Bots in 2018 – Automated Trading Guide"]
Link = ["https://captainaltcoin.com/best-bitcoin-trading-bots/"] 
Description = "Trading bots is a technique that uses pre-programmed software that analyzes market actions, such as volume, orders, price, and time, and they are rather common in the bitcoin world, because very few traders have time to stare at the charts all day. Bots or program trading is used within many global stock exchanges. Most people trade bitcoin as a way to generate passive income while working their regular day jobs, and bitcoin trading bots are said to establish more efficient trading. Bitcoin trading bots can be utilized on many well-known cryptocurrency exchanges today. There are bots that are free of charge and can be downloaded online, and there are also trading bot services you have to pay for, offered by various trading engine and programming companies.\n\nWith so many people relying on trading bots, the question becomes which one should be avoided and which one can be trusted. Below is a list of top 6 best cryptocurrency trading bots. However, your mileage may vary when using them."

["Algorithmic Cryptocurrency Swing Trading Strategy Part 1"]
Link = ["https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/algorithmic-cryptocurrency-swing-trading-strategy-part-eremenko/"] 
Description = "The current crypto market is probably one of the biggest bubbles of our time. The largely unsophisticated adoption & sentiment-driven market (you cant convince me 'dogecoin' & 'crypto kitties' have fundamental value) presents an opportunity to take advantage of the mania & volatility of the market using a multi-asset momentum strategy. The simple thinking here is that people like to jump on the 'next hot coin' & with the market; driven by technical & sentiment-based factors (hey! did you hear about ripple? It's up 1000% last week & is the next hot thing !!) and that can provide an opportunity for systematically exploiting the investor sentiment.\n\nStrategies that take advantage of modest short to medium term moves are known as swing trading strategies. In our algorithm, we use the Parabolic Time/Price System as our indicator which is an adaptive momentum indicator which adjusts to the speed of the trend. Its basic premise is that we want to enter into trades that must continue to be profitable or it will be liquidated (similar to any trend following system). Our exit signal generated from this is much tighter if the market is moving up quickly rather than if it was moving slowly helping us keep most of our profits from the latest 'swing'."

["High Frequency Trading on the Coinbase Exchange"]
Link = ["https://www.coindesk.com/high-frequency-trading-on-the-coinbase-exchange/"] 
Description = "I’ve recently started trading bitcoins algorithmically on the new Coinbase exchange. After reading about high-frequency trading in the book Flash Boys by Michael Lewis, I decided I’d give it a shot myself, albeit in a clumsier, more amateurish way.\n\nThe experience has been fascinating, both on a technical level, and in a strategic sense. Writing logic that controls money itself is a strange thing. Setting it loose for the first time, knowing that any bug could literally throw away cash, was terrifying.\n\nBitcoin is an incredibly open system that is particularly friendly to no-name developers. The exchanges have open API’s that allow anyone, literally anyone, to trade. There’s no premium access, no expensive trading floor credentials. It’s totally open – I love that."

Description = "If you can get this right your trade bot can make money by automatic trading. This bot can do it's own technical analysis and profit for you. Of course this also has implications for Steem and Steemit as bots are also on Steem. Expect these Steemit bots to get smarter if people choose to refine and test the algorithms are the algorithms are the secret sauce of profit bots.\n\nPython is very simple. A programmer coming from C or C++ can learn Python over a weekend. Writing bots is one of the most simple tasks in Python. Algorithmic trading code is usually very simple scripts but the quality of the algorithms are what make the difference and an algorithm is only as good as it's data sources and it's strategies."

["Python for analysing financial markets"]
Link = ["http://www.automatedtrader.net/articles/technology-strategy/157883/python-for-analysing-financial-markets"] 
Description = "This article is split into three parts. Firstly, we discuss the relative merits of various programming languages for analysing financial markets. This part is especially relevant for readers less familiar with Python or coding in general. There are short explanations of how some of the more common languages operate and what is of particular importance when it comes to performance and usability.\n\nSecondly, we go into detail about the libraries available in Python to analyse data. Our discussion covers some libraries which might be less well-known within the Python data community. We suggest that developers familiar with Python should jump to this part.\n\nFinally, we introduce Cuemacro's open-source financial market libraries written in Python: Chartpy (visualisation), Findatapy (market data) and Finmarketpy (backtesting trading strategies). We conclude by presenting some examples of market analysis written in Python using these libraries."
