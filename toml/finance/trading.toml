Link = ["https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3198694"]
Description = "We apply time series analysis to investigate the market cycles of Initial Coin Offerings (ICOs) as well as bitcoin and Ether. Our results show that shocks to ICO volumes are persistent and that shocks in bitcoin and Ether prices have a substantial and positive effect on these volumes – with the effect of bitcoin shocks being of shorter duration than that of Ether shocks. Moreover, higher ICO volumes cause lower bitcoin and Ether prices. Finally, bitcoin shocks positively influence Ether but not the other way round. Our study has implications for financial practice, in particular for cryptocurrency investors and entrepreneurial firms conducting ICOs. June 2018"

["Are Weather-Based Trading Strategies Profitable?"]
Link = ["https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3111467"]
Description = "We estimate the profitability of global index-level trading strategies formed on daily weather across 49 countries. We use ex ante weather information combined with the statistical relationship between daily weather and country index returns to predict index returns on each day. We then form a long-short hedge strategy and a long-only strategy, and find that both strategies generate substantially out-of-sample gross profits. The long-only strategy produces more consistent annualized profits of up to 20.5%, as opposed to a mean world index return of 3.75% during 1993-2012. These findings help solidify the claim that weather exerts economically important impact on mood, and investors can trade profitably on daily weather."

A dead cat bounce is a small, short-lived recovery in the price of a declining security, such as a stock. Frequently, downtrends are interrupted by brief periods of recovery — or small rallies — where prices temporarily rise. The name \"dead cat bounce\" is based on the notion that even a dead cat will bounce if it falls far enough and fast enough."

When talking to new traders I like to give the example of a poker player. You start out small and overtime you end up building your bankroll/trading capital to a sizable amount. What makes the R multiple so helpful is it allows you to size your position relative to risk. This allows you to understand the risks required when trading and risk what you are comfortable with.

Description = "Have the mindset in crypto that everyone is against you. They are using you for their own benefit/gains. No matter what type of relationship you have with individuals you meet online at the end of the day it means nothing. You steal 100k? Its forgotten after a while, You donated 100k? it's forgotten after a while. Nobody truly gives a shit. It's just them reacting too a certain situation in the moment. The reality is they only care about themselves and theirs nothing wrong with that. I remember reading threads on /r/cryptocurrency in the last bull-run where everyone was holding hands, singing kumbaya, and talking about lambos... Did you guys all think you were gonna make gains? Someone has to lose for the other person to win. High majority of this space works just like a ponzi and it should be treated as such."
