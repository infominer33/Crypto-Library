# Tag Definitions

It has become apparent that we need a key for tagging standards. ultimately each tag will have additional tags related to it for search purposes, but this document to define "top-level" tags (or tags that are visible to and navigable by the user) is in progress. 

All source items will be as inclusively tagged as possible. As many tags as applicable will be used for each item. For example, everything related to bitcoin will have the 'bitcoin' tag, while some will have additional bitcoin related tags, depending upon the content.

### Bitcoin Related

'bitcoin' = Master tag, everything related
'btc-protocol' = anything pertaining to the protocol
'btc-lyr2' = protocols built onto bitcoin, such as lightning or liquid
'btc-app' = applications integrating bitcoin somehow
'btc-wallet'
'btc-fork' = any software based upon bitcoin


### Ethereum Related

'ethereum-protocol' = anything pertaining to the protocol
'eth-lyr2' = eg. State Channels, Plasma, and Truebit
'eth-app' = applications integrating bitcoin somehow
'eth-wallet'
