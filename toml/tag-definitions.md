# Tag Definitions

It has become apparent that we need a key for tagging standards. ultimately each tag will have additional tags related to it for search purposes, but this document to define "top-level" tags (or tags that are visible to and navigable by the user) is in progress. 

All source items will be as inclusively tagged as possible. As many tags as applicable will be used for each item. For example, everything related to bitcoin will have the 'bitcoin' tag, while some will have additional bitcoin related tags, depending upon the content.

Tagging "Rules":
* Each company, organization, and project gets its own tag.
* More prominent projects get multiple tags to make their abundant resources easier to navigate.
Generally speaking tags should be used liberally, so that 'bitcoin', for example, will be used as a tag for anything related to bitcoin, and additional tags are used to define further.
* All tags are lower case
