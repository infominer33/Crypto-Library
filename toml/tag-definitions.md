# Tag Definitions

It has become apparent that we need a key for tagging standards. ultimately each tag will have additional tags related to it for search purposes, but this document to define "top-level" tags (or tags that are visible to and navigable by the user) is in progress. 

All source items will be as inclusively tagged as possible. As many tags as applicable will be used for each item. For example, everything related to bitcoin will have the 'bitcoin' tag, while some will have additional bitcoin related tags, depending upon the content.

Tagging "Rules":
* Each company, organization, and project gets its own tag.
* More prominent projects get multiple tags to make their abundant resources easier to navigate.
Generally speaking tags should be used liberally, so that 'bitcoin', for example, will be used as a tag for anything related to bitcoin, and additional tags are used to define further.
* All tags are lower case

### General

Every SuperSource Item must have at least one of the following tags: (maybe need more 'super'-tags)
'organization' -for non profit
'business' -for profit
'protocol'
'app'
'research-paper'
'documentation'
'blog'
'academic'
'state'  For state\federal govt based projects
'enterprise' For private and\or permissioned chains
'dlt'

Any blockchain or dlt will be one of the three
'private-permissioned'
'public-permissioned'
'public'

### Bitcoin Related

'bitcoin' = Master tag, everything related
'btc-protocol' = anything pertaining to the protocol
'btc-lyr2' = protocols built onto bitcoin, such as lightning or liquid
'btc-app' = applications integrating bitcoin somehow
'btc-wallet'
'btc-fork' = any software based upon bitcoin


### Ethereum Related

'ethereum' = master tag for everything related
'eth-protocol' = anything pertaining to the protocol
'eth-lyr2' = eg. State Channels, Plasma, and Truebit
'eth-app' = applications integrating bitcoin somehow
'eth-wallet'
'eth-fork' = any software based upon bitcoin


### Identity Related
There are a lot more identity tags than this. but there are a few to keep in mind.

'blockchain-id'    \
'decentralized-id'  > These three are differentiated because many projects check all three, but some only check 1 or 2.
'self-sovereign'   /
'identification'  - Anything related to identification, but not specificly did or self sovereign related. For items that don't fit in other classifications

'w3c' - should always be tagged with the following 
(at least I think verifiable claims are always related to w3c, but credentials could be unrelated.)
'did'
'verifiable-claims'
'credentials'

\* each item recieving a sovrin tag should also recieve an evernym tag, 
\* each item recieving an indy should also recieve a sovrin tag. 
   - so that one 'source level' back is always referenced.
'evernym' - originators of the codebase that was passed on to the sovrin foundation
'sovrin' - and further developed and deployed, passing forward the code to the hyperledger foundation
'indy' -
